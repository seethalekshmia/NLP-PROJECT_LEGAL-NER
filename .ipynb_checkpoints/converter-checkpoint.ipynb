P. Khaitan, (section N. Mukherjea and Rajinder Narain, with him) for the appellant.\\r\\nM. C. Setalvad, Attorney General for India, (A. N. Sen, V. section Sawhney and section P. Varma, with him) for the respondents.\\r\\nNovember 1.\\r\\nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered by MUKHERJEA J.\\r\\nThis appeal is directed against a judgment of an appellate bench of the Calcutta High Court, dated the 24th February, 1953, reversing, on appeal, the judgment and order of a single Judge sitting on the Original Side of that Court, passed on an application under section 34 of the .\\r\\nThe material facts are not in controversy and may be shortly stated as follows: On the 7th of July, 1950, the respondent, Moran and Company Limited, passed two Bought Notes to the appellant company, couched in identical terms, under which the appellant purchased 12,00,000 yards of hessian cloth, 6,00,000 yards under each contract, on certain terms and conditions stated therein.\\r\\nThe delivery was to be made every month from January, 1951, at the rate of 1,00,000 yards per month under 864 each of these notes and payments were to be made in cash \\'on delivery, each delivery being treated as a separate and distinct contract.\\r\\nThe Bought Notes commenced thus: Dear Sirs, We have this day Bought by your order and on your account from our Principals.\\r\\n\" The particulars of the goods, the price, the time of delivery and other terms of the contract are then set out and amongst the terms is an arbitration clause worded as follows: \" All matters, questions, disputes, differences and/ or claims arising out of and/or concerning and/or in connection with and/or in consequence of or relating to this contract, whether or not the obligations of either or both parties under this contract be subsisting at the time of such dispute and, whether or not this contract has been terminated or purported to be terminated or completed, shall be referred to the arbitration of the Bengal Chamber of Commerce under the rules of its Tribunal of Arbitration for the time being in force and according to such rules the arbitration shall be conducted.\\r\\n\" The notes were signed by the respondent, Moran and Company, describing themselves as brokers.\\r\\nIt is admitted that the goods covered by the Bought Notes were delivered to the appellant in all the months from January to June, 1951, with the exception of the goods due to be delivered for the month of March, 1951.\\r\\nThe appellant required from the respondent delivery of goods in respect of the month of March but the latter informed the appellant, by a letter dated the 27th March, 1951, that its principals disowned a liability in this respect as there was default on the part of the appellant in not giving shipping instructions for the said goods within the time mentioned in the contracts.\\r\\nThe appellant denied any default on its part and did not also accept the position that the respondent had any principal, and on the 27th of April, 1951, it sent its bills to the respondent claiming Rs. 1,13,042 3 0 as damages for non delivery of the 865 goods.\\r\\nAs the respondent did not comply with this demand, the appellant contemplated referring the matter in dispute to the arbitration of the Bengal Chamber of Commerce as provided in the contracts and while it was preparing to take steps in that direction, the respondent, on the 11th of June, 1951, filed a suit against the appellant in the Original Side of the Calcutta High Court (being Suit No. 2516 of 1951,) and it is in respect of this suit that the application under section 34 of the has been made.\\r\\nIt was alleged in the plaint that the plaintiff acted merely as broker and in that capacity brought about the two contracts of sale and purchase evidenced by the two Bought Notes mentioned above, that the real seller was a firm known as Gowarchand Danchand, and that the plaintiff not being a party to the contract could not incur any liability under its terms.\\r\\nThere were prayers in the plaint for a declaration that the plaint.\\r\\noff was not a party to the said contracts and, that it had no liability under the same.\\r\\nThere was a further prayer for an injunction restraining the respondent from, claiming any damages in respect of the said contracts The writ of summons was served on the appellant on the 23rd of June, 1951.\\r\\nOn the 19th July, 1951, it filed an application under section 34 of the praying that the proceedings in the suit may be stayed in order that the matter in dispute between the parties may be dealt with under the arbitration clause contained in the contracts.\\r\\nThe application was heard by Das Gupta J. who allowed the prayer of the applicant and stayed further proceedings in the suit.\\r\\nIn the opinion of the learned Judge the dispute in this case was not whether there was any contract entered into by and between the appellant and the respondent: but whether the respondent, who admittedly passed the two Bought Notes to the appellant, could be made liable under the contract by reason of the fact that it described itself as broker.\\r\\nThe answer to this question depended according to the learned Judge upon the interpretation of the contract itself and the dispute arising as.\\r\\nit did out of or concerning or relating to the 866 contracts would come within the purview of the arbitration clause.\\r\\nAgainst this judgment the respondent took an appeal to the Appellate Division of the High Court and the appeal was heard by a bench consisting of Chakravartti C.J. and Sarkar J.\\r\\nBy two separate judgments which concurred in the result, the Chief Justice and the other learned Judge allowed the appeal and vacated the order for stay.\\r\\nIt is against this judgment that the appellant has come to this Court on the strength of a certificate under article 133(1)(a) of the Constitution.\\r\\nThe short point for our consideration is, whether on the facts of this case, the appellant is entitled to an order under section 34 of the , staying the proceedings of the suit commenced by the respondent.\\r\\nSection 34 of the is in these terms: \" Where any party to an arbitration agreement or any person claiming under him commences any legal proceedings against any other party to the agreement or any person claiming under him in respect of any matter agreed to be referred, any party to such legal proceedings may, at any time before filing a written statement or taking any other steps in the proceedings, apply to the judicial authority before which the proceedings are pending to stay the proceedings; and if satisfied that there is no sufficient reason why the matter should not be referred in accordance with the arbitration agreement and that the applicant was, at the time when the proceedings were commenced, and still remains, ready and willing to do all things necessary to the proper conduct of the arbitration, such authority may make an order staying the proceedings.\\r\\n\" Thus in order that a stay may be granted under this section, it is necessary that the following conditions should be fulfilled: (1)The proceeding must have been commenced by a party to an arbitration agreement against any other party to the agreement; (2)the legal proceeding which is sought to be.\\r\\nstayed must be in respect of a matter agreed to be referred 867 (3)the applicant for stay must be a party to the legal proceeding and he must have taken no step in the proceeding after appearance.\\r\\nIt is also necessary that he should satisfy the Court not only that he is but also was at the commencement of the proceedings ready and willing to do everything necessary for the proper conduct of the arbitration; and (4)the Court must be satisfied that there is no sufficient reason why the matter should not be referred to an arbitration in accordance with the arbitration agreement.\\r\\nThe third condition can be taken to have been fulfilled on the facts of the present case, and the fourth is one which is exclusively for the determination of the Court.\\r\\nThe controversy between the parties centres round the other two conditions, namely, conditions (1) and (2) ; and unless the applicant for stay succeeds in establishing that the respondent is a party to an arbitration agreement and that the subject matter of dispute in the suit is a matter coming within the scope of such agreement, it cannot possibly ask the Court to order a stay of the proceedings, under section 34 of the .\\r\\nThe learned Judges of the appellate bench of the High Court have taken the view that the only matter in dispute between the parties to the suit is whether the plaintiff was a party to the contract.\\r\\nIt was definitely alleged by the plaintiff that the contract was not between it and the appellant but was one between the appellant and a third party and since the arbitration agreement is contained in the contract, it is an agreement between those parties only, which could not bind or affect the plaintiff in any way.\\r\\nThe dispute, it is said, which is the subject matter of the suit does not arise under the contract and does not relate to it; it is outside the contract altogether and does not come within the scope of the arbitration agreement.\\r\\nThe decision in the appeal therefore rests entirely on the finding of the learned Judges that the matter in dispute between the parties to the suit does not come within the ambit of the arbitration clause.\\r\\nIn view of this decision the learned Judges did not consider it necessary to go into the first point as to whether in fact 868 there was a binding arbitration agreement between the parties to the suit.\\r\\nThe learned Chief Justice no doubt did in a manner consider that point also, but he refrained from pronouncing any decision upon it, being of opinion that a decision on this question which was the only issue in the suit itself might prejudice the parties and create a bar of res judicata against one or the other.\\r\\nWe think that on the facts of this case it was necessary for the learned Judges of the appellate bench to decide the question as to whether or not the plaintiff in the suit which the applicant wants to stay was a party to the arbitration agreement.\\r\\nThis would have a material bearing on the decision of the other question upon which the learned Judges rested their judgments.\\r\\nThe first and essential pre requisite to making an order of stay under section 34 of the is that there is a binding arbitration agreement between the parties to the suit which is sought to be stayed.\\r\\nThe question whether the dispute in the suit falls within the arbitration clause really pre supposes that there is such agreement and involves consideration of two matters, viz., (1) what is the dispute in the suit and (2) what disputes the arbitration clause covers?(1).\\r\\nThe contention raised by the plaintiff in the present suit is, that the contract was really between the appellant and another party and not between it and the appellant and consequently it was not bound by the contract and could not be made liable for any damages in terms thereof.\\r\\nIn substance therefore the controversy between the parties in the suit is whether the plaintiff did incur any liability in terms of the contracts evidenced by the two Bought Notes to which it was a signatory no matter in whatever capacity.\\r\\nThe question whether the plaintiff was a party to the agreement at all is undoubtedly one which cannot go before the arbitrators and with that question they cannot possibly deal.\\r\\nBut as Lord Porter pointed out in Heyman vs Darwins (2), \"this does not mean that in every instance (1) Vide per Viscount Simon in Heyman vs Darwins, at 360.\\r\\n(2) , 393.\\r\\n869 in which it is claimed that the arbitrator has no juris diction the Court will refuse to stay an action.\\r\\nIf this were the case such a claim would always defeat an agreement to submit disputes to arbitration, at any rate until the question of jurisdiction had been decided.\\r\\nThe Court to which an application for stay is made is put in possession of the facts and arguments and must in such a case make up its mind whether the arbitrator has jurisdiction or not as best it can on the evidence before it.\\r\\nIndeed, the application for stay gives an opportunity for putting these and other considerations before the court that it may determine whether the action shall be stayed or not.\\r\\n\" Section 34 of the as is well known is a virtual reproduction of section 4 of the English of 1889.\\r\\nThe observations quoted above were approved of by Mr. Justice section R. Das in the case of Khusiram V. Hanutmal (1) and it was held by the learned Judge that where on an application made under section 34 of the for stay of a suit, an issue is raised as to the formation, existence or validity of the con.\\r\\ntract containing the arbitration clause, the Court is not bound to refuse a stay but may in its discretion, on the application for stay, decide the issue as to the existence or validity of the arbitration agreement even though it may involve incidentally a decision as to the validity or existence of the parent contract.\\r\\nWe are in entire agreement with the view enunciated above.\\r\\nAs we have said already, it is incumbent upon the Court when invited to stay a suit under section 34 of the to decide first of all whether there is a binding agreement for arbitration between the parties to the suit.\\r\\nSo far as the present case is concerned if it is held that the arbitration agreement and the contract containing it were between the parties to the suit, the dispute in the present suit would be one relating to the rights and liabilities of the parties on the basis of the contract itself and would come within the purview of the arbitration clause worded as it is in the widest of terms, in accordance with the principle enunciated by this Court in A. M. Nair and (1) at 518.\\r\\n870 Company vs Gordhandass (1).\\r\\nIf on the other hand it is held that the plaintiff was not a party to the agreement, the application for stay must necessarily be dismissed.\\r\\nThe appellate Judges of the High Court in our opinion held rightly that the decision in A. M. Mair and Company vs Gordhandass (1) was not in any sense conclusive in the present case on the question of the dispute in the suit being included in the arbitration agreement.\\r\\nThe report shows that the dispute in that case was whether the appellants had made the contract in their own right as principals or on behalf of the Bengal Jute Mill Company as agents of the latter.\\r\\nThe decision of this question was held to turn upon a true construction of the contract and consequently it was a dispute under or arising out of or concerning the contract.\\r\\nThe judgment proceeds on the footing that there was in fact a contract between the parties and the only dispute was in which character they were parties to it, the respondents contending that the appellants were not bound as principals while the latter said that they were.\\r\\nMr. Justice Fazl Ali in delivering the judgment pointed out that the error into which the learned Judges of the appellate bench of the High Court appeared to have fallen was their regarding the dispute raised by the respondent in respect of the position of the appellants under the contract as having the same consequence as a dispute as to the contract never having been entered into.\\r\\nIn this case it is certainly not admitted that the respondent was a party to the contract.\\r\\nIn fact that is the subject matter of controversy in the suit itself.\\r\\nBut, as has been said already, the question having been raised , in this application, under section 34 of the , the Court has undoubted jurisdiction to decide it for the purpose of finding as to whether or not there is a binding arbitration agreement between the, parties to the suit.\\r\\nIt has been said by Chakravartti C.J. and in our opinion rightly, that if the person whose concern with the agreement is in question is a signatory to,the contract and formally a (1) ; 871 contracting party, that will be sufficient to enable the Court to hold for purposes of section 34 that he is a party to the agreement.\\r\\nIt was the contention of the respondent in the Court below that this test was not fulfilled in the present case.\\r\\nThe point has been canvassed before us also by Mr. Sen and it has been argued on the authority of several decided cases that in cases of this description the Bought Note is a mere intimation to the buyer, that the orders of the latter have been carried out and purchases have been made from other persons and not from them.\\r\\nThe writer does not thereby become a party to the contract of purchase and sale even as an agent.\\r\\nHe remains a mere broker or intermediary and the provision of section 230(2) of the Contract Act \\'Cannot be invoked against him.\\r\\nMr. Khaitan on the other hand argues that the English law being quite different from the Indian law regarding the liability of an agent contracting on behalf of an undisclosed principal, the English authorities are no guide to a solution of the problem.\\r\\nIt is said that the case of Patiram Banerjee vs Kanknarrah Co., Ltd.(1), upon which the respondent relies, was wrongly decided being based upon English authorities which have no application to India.\\r\\nThe respondent here, it is pointed out, signed an elaborate document setting out in full every particular of the contract entered into and it is impossible to say that he was not an agent executing a contract on behalf of another whose identity he did not disclose but was a mere intermediary conveying an information to the buyer.\\r\\nIn our opinion, the point is not free from doubt and requires careful consideration and as it was not decided by the learned Judges of the High Court and we have not the advantage of having their views upon it, the proper course for us to follow would be to send the case back for a hearing of and decision on this point.\\r\\nWe, therefore, allow the appeal and set aside the judgments of both the Courts below.\\r\\nThe matter will go back to the appellate bench of the Calcutta High Court which will decide as an issue in the proceeding under section 34 of the the question whether the respondent was or was not a party (1) Cal.\\r\\nI050. 872 to the arbitration agreement.\\r\\nIf the Court is of opinion that the respondent was in fact a party, the suit shall be stayed and the appellant would be allowed to, proceed by way of arbitration in accordance with the arbitration clause.\\r\\nIf on the other hand the finding is adverse to the appellant, the application will be dismissed.\\r\\nThe appellant will have its costs of this appeal.\\r\\nFurther costs between the parties will abide the result.\\r\\nAppeal allowed.\\r\\n', {'entities': [[0, 23, 'CASE_NUMBER'], [70, 89, 'DATE'], [98, 134, 'COURT'], [159, 179, 'PRECEDENT'], [216, 240, 'DATE'], [249, 271, 'COURT'], [288, 330, 'PRECEDENT'], [334, 339, 'DATE'], [341, 354, 'LAWYER'], [365, 377, 'LAWYER'], [382, 398, 'LAWYER'], [429, 443, 'LAWYER'], [474, 534, 'LAWYER'], [558, 569, 'DATE'], [614, 626, 'JUDGE'], [700, 719, 'COURT'], [731, 750, 'DATE'], [890, 900, 'PROVISION'], [998, 1009, 'DATE'], [1011, 1015, 'DATE'], [1033, 1058, 'RESPONDENT'], [1347, 1351, 'DATE'], [2281, 2307, 'ORG'], [2491, 2508, 'RESPONDENT'], [2658, 2680, 'DATE'], [2750, 2762, 'DATE'], [2919, 2935, 'DATE'], [3276, 3295, 'DATE'], [3542, 3568, 'ORG'], [3681, 3699, 'DATE'], [3764, 3783, 'COURT'], [3791, 3812, 'CASE_NUMBER'], [3876, 3886, 'PROVISION'], [4147, 4166, 'OTHERS'], [4618, 4637, 'DATE'], [4646, 4661, 'DATE'], [4693, 4703, 'PROVISION'], [4927, 4939, 'JUDGE'], [5784, 5801, 'JUDGE'], [5806, 5815, 'JUDGE'], [6081, 6101, 'PROVISION'], [6242, 6252, 'PROVISION'], [6328, 6338, 'PROVISION'], [8671, 8681, 'PROVISION'], [10616, 10626, 'PROVISION'], [11757, 11778, 'PRECEDENT'], [11854, 11871, 'PRECEDENT'], [12585, 12595, 'PROVISION'], [12649, 12673, 'PROVISION'], [12878, 12888, 'PROVISION'], [13464, 13474, 'PROVISION'], [14074, 14096, 'PRECEDENT'], [14333, 14374, 'PRECEDENT'], [14665, 14689, 'ORG'], [15166, 15186, 'JUDGE'], [15808, 15818, 'PROVISION'], [16022, 16039, 'JUDGE'], [16278, 16288, 'PROVISION'], [16927, 16941, 'PROVISION'], [17278, 17321, 'PRECEDENT'], [18248, 18267, 'COURT'], [18322, 18332, 'PROVISION'], [18813, 18877, 'PROCEDURES']]}]\n",

D. Bhargava and Naunit Lal, with him) for the appellants.\\r\\nK. L. Misra, Advocate General for the State of U.P., and Jagdish Swarup (J. K. Srivastva and C. P. Lal, with them) for the respondents.\\r\\nOctober 13.\\r\\nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered by MUKHERJEA J.\\r\\nThe appellant in these two analogous appeals, along with many others, have been carrying on the business of plying motor vehicles, as ,stage carriages \\' on hire, on the Bulandshabr Delhi route from a number of years past.\\r\\nThe running of these vehicles has been regulated so long by the Motor Vehicles Act of 1939 which provides, inter alia, for granting of driving licences, the registration of vehicles and exercising control over transport vehicles through permits granted by Regional Transport Authorities.\\r\\nSection 42(3) of the Act exempts transport vehicles, owned by or on behalf of the Central Government or the Provincial Government from the necessity of obtaining permits unless the vehicles were used in connection Path the business of an Indian State Railway.\\r\\nIt appears, that some time after 1947 the Government of U. P. conceived the idea of running their own buses on the public thoroughfares.\\r\\nThey first started running buses only as competitors with the private operators but later on they decided to exclude all private bus owners from the field and establish a complete State monopoly in respect to the road transport business.\\r\\nThey sought to achieve this object by 711 calling in aid the provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act itself.\\r\\nUnder section 42(3) of the Act as mentioned above, the Government had not to obtain permits for their own vehicles and they could run any number of buses as they liked without the necessity of taking out permits for them.\\r\\nThe Transport Authorities, in furtherance of this State policy, began cancelling the permits already issued to private operators and refusing permits to people who would otherwise have been entitled to them.\\r\\nUpon this, a number of private bus owners filed petitions in the Allahabad High Court under article 226 of the Constitution praying for appropriate relief, by way of writs, against what was described as the illegal use of the provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act by the Government of U. P.\\r\\nThese petitions were heard by a Full Bench of five Judges and four judgments were delivered dealing with various questions that were raised by the parties.\\r\\nA majority of the judges expressed the opinion that the State, purporting to act under section 42(3) of the Motor Vehicles Act, could not \\'discriminate against other persons in their own favour and that the sub section, in so far as it purports to exempt State Transport buses from the obligation to obtain permits for their use, conflicts with article 14 of the Constitution.\\r\\nAll the judges concurred in holding that nationalisation of an industry was not possible by a mere executive order without appropriate legislation and such legislation would probably have to be justified under article 19(6) of the Constitution.\\r\\nAs a result of this decision the Transport Authorities were directed to deal with the applications for permits, made by the various private bus owners, in accordance with the provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act, without in any way being influenced by the consideration that the State Government wanted to run buses of their own on certain routes.\\r\\nIn view of this pronouncement of law, the State Government, which wanted to have the exclusive right to operate Road Transport Services within its territory, sought the assistance of the Legislature and the U. P. Road Transport Act (Act II of 1951) was passed and 712 became law on and from the 10th of February, 1951.\\r\\nIt is the constitutional validity of this enactment which is the subject matter of contest in these present proceedings.\\r\\nThe preamble to the Road Transport Act (hereinafter called \"The Act\") says: \"Whereas it is expedient in the interest of the general public and for the promotion of the suitable and efficient road transport to provide for a State Road Transport Services in Uttar Pradesh, it is enacted as follows.\\r\\n\" Section 2 gives definitions of certain terms, while section 3, which is the most material section in the Act, embodies virtually its whole purpose.\\r\\nIt provides that where the State Government is satisfied that it is necessary, in the interest of general public and for sub serving the common good, so to direct, it may declare that the Road Transport Services in general, or any particular class of such service on any route or portion thereof, shall be \\'run and operated by the State Government exclusively or by the State Government in conjunction with railway or partly by the State Government and partly by others in accordance with the provisions of this Act.\\r\\nSection 4 provides for publication of a scheme framed in accordance with the above declaration and objections to such scheme can be made by interested persons in the manner laid down in section 5.As soon as the scheme is finalised, certain consequences follow which are detailed in section 7.\\r\\nSo long as the scheme continues in force, the State Government shall have the exclusive right to operate Road Transport Services, or if the scheme so provides, a certain fixed number of transport vehicles belonging to others can also be run on those roads.\\r\\nThe State Government shall be authorised in all such cases to direct the dispensation of the State Transport vehicles from the necessity of taking out permits, or to cancel, alter or modify any existing permits or to add any fresh condition to any permit in respect of any transport vehicle.\\r\\nThe remaining portion of the Act purports to lay down how the provisions of the Act are to be worked out and implemented.\\r\\nSections 8 and 9 provide respectively for the appointment of a Transport Commission and Advisory Committees.\\r\\nUnder section 10 the State Government may delegate its powers under the Act to an officer or authority subordinate to it.\\r\\nSection 12 makes it an offence for any person to drive a public service vehicle or allow such vehicle to be used in contravention of the provisions of section 7.\\r\\nIt is not necessary to refer to the provisions of the remaining sections as they are not material for our present purpose.\\r\\nBy a notification dated the 25th of March, 1953, the U. P. Government published a declaration in terms of section 3 of the Act, to the effect, that the State carriage services, among others, on the Bulandshar Delhi route, shall be run and operated exclusively by the State Government.\\r\\nA further notification issued on the 7th of April following set out what purported to be a scheme for the operation of the State carriage services on these routes.\\r\\nThereupon the two appel lants as well as several other private bus owners numbering 106 in all, who plied transport buses on these routes, presented petitions under article 226 of the Constitution before the High Court at Allahabad praying for writs, in the nature of mandamus, directing the U. P. Government and the State Transport Authorities not to interfere with the operation of the stage carriages of the petitioners and to refrain from operating the State Road Transport Service except in accordance with the provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act.\\r\\nThe constitutional validity of the Act was challenged on a number of grounds, the principal contentions being: (1)that the Act was discriminatory in its character and contravened the provisions of article 14 of the Constitution; (2)that it conflicted with the fundamental rights of the petitioners guaranteed under article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution; and (3)that it was an invalid piece of legislation as it purported to acquire the interest of the petitioners in a commercial undertaking without making any provision for compensation as is required under article 31(2) 714 of the Constitution.\\r\\nIt was further argued that the Act violated the guarantee of freedom of inter State and intra state trade embodied in article 301 of the Constitution.\\r\\nAll these writ petitions were heard by a Division Bench of the High Court consisting of Mukherji and Chaturvedi JJ.\\r\\nBy two separate but concurring judgments dated the 17th of November, 1953, the learned Judges repelled all the contentions of the petitioners and dismissed the writ petitions.\\r\\nIt is against this decision that these two appeals have come up to this Court on the strength of certificates granted by the High Court and Mr. Gopal Swarup Pathak appearing in support of the appeals has reiterated practically all the grounds which were urged on behalf of his clients in the Court below.\\r\\nWe will take up these points in proper order and it will be convenient first of all to address ourselves to the two allied questions, viz., whether the appellants could claim any fundamental right under article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution which can be said to have been violated by the impugned legislation, and whether the Act has deprived them of any \\'property \\' which would attract the operation of article 31 of the Constitution? Mr. Pathak argues that a right to carry on any occupation, trade or business is guaranteed to all citizens by article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution.\\r\\nThe appellants in the present cases were carrying on the business of plying buses on hire on a public highway until now and the Act which prevents them from pursuing that trade or business conflicts therefore with the fundamental right guaranteed under article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution.\\r\\nIt is said also that this beneficial interest of the appellants in the commercial undertaking is \\'property \\' within the meaning of article 31(2) of the Constitution and as the Act does not conform to the requirements of that article, it must be held to be void.\\r\\nMr. Pathak put forward another and a somewhat novel argument that the right of the appellants to use a public highway for purposes of trade is in the nature of an easement and as such can be reckoned as property 715 in law; consequently there has been a deprivation of property by the impugned legislation in this sense also.\\r\\nThis contention seems to us to be untenable and it was rightly abandoned by the learned counsel.\\r\\nThe Advocate General appearing for the State of \\'U. P. did not and could not dispute that a right to pursue any trade, business or occupation of one \\'s choice is guaranteed by the Constitution.\\r\\nHe says however that this does not mean that a citizen can carry on his trade or business anywhere he likes and such right is also guaranteed by the Constitution.\\r\\nHe must have a legal right to use a particular place for purposes of his trade or business, before he can resist any encroachment upon it on the strength of the constitutional guarantee.\\r\\nHis argument in substance is, that the bus owners, as members of the public, have no legal right to ply buses on hire on any public road.\\r\\nThe only right which a member of the public can assert in respect of a highway is the right of passing and repassing over it.\\r\\nThe State in which all public ways vest under the law has the sole right to determine whether it would allow any citizen to carry on a trade or business upon a public highway and if so, to what extent.\\r\\nThe citizen has no inherent right in this respect apart from any State sanction.\\r\\nThe position, therefore is, that the rights of the appellants, as indeed those of the other bus owners, are created entirely by State legislation and by State legislation they could be deprived of the same.\\r\\nThere is no question of any conflict with the fundamental right guaranteed under article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution in such cases.\\r\\nThe argument requires careful consideration.\\r\\nIt is not disputed that the Bulandshahr Delhi route is a part of the Grand Trunk Road which is a public highway.\\r\\nAccording to English law, which has been applied all along in India, a highway has its origin, apart from statute, in dedication, either express or implied, by the owner of land of a right of passage over it to the public and the acceptance of that right by the public (1).\\r\\nIn the large majority of cases this dedication is presumed from long and uninterrupted (1) Vide Pratt & Mackenzie on Law of Highways, 19th edn.p. 13.716 user of a way by the public, and the presumption in such cases is so strong as to dispense with all enquiry into the actual intention of the owner of the soil and it is not even material to enquire who the owner was ().\\r\\nThe fact that the members of the public have a right of passing and repassing over a highway does not mean however that all highways could be legitimately used as foot passages only and that any other user is possible only with the permission or sufferance of the State.\\r\\nIt is from the nature of the user that the extent of the right of passage has to be inferred and the settled principle is that the right extends to all forms of traffic which have been usual and accustomed and also to all which are reasonably similar and incidental thereto ( 2).\\r\\nThe law has thus been stated in Halsbury \\'s Laws of England(1): \"Where a highway originates in an inferred dedication, it is a question of fact what kind of traffic it was so dedicated for, having regard to the character of the way and the nature of the user prior to the date at which they infer dedication; and a right of passage once acquired will extend to more modern forms of traffic reasonably similar to those for which the highway was originally dedicated, so long as they do not impose a substantially greater burden on the owner of the soil.\\r\\n\" There can be no dispute that the Grand Trunk Road which, as a public highway, has been in existence since the 15th Century A. D. has been used for all sorts of vehicular traffic that were in vogue at different times.\\r\\nMotor vehicles were certainly not known when the road came into existence but the use of motor vehicles in modern times as means of locomotion and transport could not, on the principle stated above, amount to an unwarrantable extension of the accustomed user to which the highway is subjected.\\r\\nIf there is any danger to the road by reason of such user, or if such user by one interferes with the user by others, it is up to the State to regulate the motor traffic or reduce the number or weigh of vehicles on the road in any way it likes, and to that no objection can possibly be taken.\\r\\nBut the right of the public to use motor vehicles on the public road cannot, in any sense, be regarded as a right created by the Motor Vehicles Act.\\r\\nThe right exists anterior to any legislation on this subject as an incident of public rights over a highway.\\r\\nThe State only controls and regulates it for the purpose of ensuring safety, peace, health and good morals of the public.\\r\\nOnce the position is accepted that a member of the public is entitled to ply motor vehicles on the public road as an incident of his right of passage over a highway, the question is really immaterial whether he plies a vehicle for pleasure or pastime or for the purpose of trade and business.\\r\\nThe nature of the right in respect to the highway is not in any way affected thereby and we cannot agree with the learned AdvocateGeneral that the user of a public road for purposes of trade is an extraordinary or special use of the highway which can be acquired only under special sanction from the State.\\r\\nThe learned Advocate General in support of his contention has referred us to a few American cases on the point.\\r\\nIn the case of Packard vs Banton(1), Sutherland J. observed as follows: \" The streets belong to the public and are primarily for the use of the public in the ordinary way.\\r\\nTheir use for purposes of gain is special and extraordinary and generally at least may be prohibited or conditioned as the Legislature deems proper.\\r\\n\" This decision was approved in Frost vs Railroad Commission(1), and again in Stephenson vs Binford(3), where Sutherland J. practically reiterated his observations in the previous case as follows: \" It is a well established law that the highways of the State are public property; that their primary and preferred use is for private purposes; and that their use for purposes of gain is special and extraordinary which generally at least the Legislature may prohibit or condition as it sees fit.\\r\\nWe do not think that this is the law of India under our Constitution.\\r\\nThe cases referred to above were noticed by the Allahabad High Court in the Full Bench decision of Motilal vs Uttar Pradesh Government(1), and two of the learned Judges constituting the Full Bench expressed their opinion that this \\'doctrine of exceptional user \\' might have been evolved by the American Courts in the same way as they evolved the \\'doctrine of police powers. \\' They both held that this American rule did not embody the English or the Indian law on the subject.\\r\\nThis identical point was investigated with considerable thoroughness in a recent decision of the Madras High Court in C. section section Motor Service vs State of Madras(2), and it was pointed out by Venkatarama Ayyar J. who delivered the judgment of the Court, that the rule of special or extraordinary use of highways in America had its roots in the doctrine of \\'franchise \\', which is still a recognised institution in that country.\\r\\nThe doctrine of \\'franchise \\' or \\'privilege \\' has its origin in English Common Law and was bound up with the old prerogative of the Crown.\\r\\nThis doctrine continued to live in the American legal world as a survival of the pre independence days, though in an altered form.\\r\\nThe place of the royal grants under the English Common Law was taken by the legislative grants in America and the grant of special rights by legislation to particular individuals or companies is regarded there as a \\'franchise \\' or \\'Privilege \\' differing from the ordinary liberties of a citizen.\\r\\nThe carrying on of transport buses by common carriers on the public road in America is a \\'franchise \\' and not a common law right, which could be claimed by all citizens and a distinction is made, as the cases cited above will show, between contract carriers who carry passengers or goods under particular contracts and common carriers whose business is affected with public interest.\\r\\nOver the latter the State claims and exercises a plenary power of control.\\r\\nAyyar J. has, in our opinion, rightly pointed out that this doctrine of \\'franchise \\' has no place in our Constitution.\\r\\nUnder the Indian Constitution the contract (i) I.L.R. 1951 All. 257.(2) 719 carries as well as the common carriers would occupy the same position so far as the guaranteed right under article 19(1) (g) is concerned and both are liable to be controlled by appropriate regulations under clause (6) of that article.\\r\\nThe law on the point, as it stands at present, has been thus summed up by the learned Judge : \"The true position then is, that all public streets and roads vest in the State, but that the State holds them as trustees on behalf of the public.\\r\\nThe members of the public are entitled as beneficiaries to use them as a matter of right and this right is limited only by the similar rights possessed by every other citizen to use the pathways.\\r\\nThe State as trustees on behalf of the public is entitled to impose all such limitations on the character and extent of the user as may be requisite for protecting the rights of the public generally ;. . but subject to such limitations the right of a citizen to carry on business in transport vehicles on public pathways cannot be denied to him on the ground that the State owns the highways.\\r\\n\" We are in entire agreement with the statement of law made in these passages.\\r\\nWithin the limits imposed by State regulations any member of the public can ply motor vehicles on a public road.\\r\\nTo that extent he can also carry on the business of transporting passengers with the aid of the vehicles.\\r\\nIt is to this carrying on of the trade or business that the guarantee in article 19(1) (g) is attracted and a citizen can legitimately complain if any legislation takes away or curtails that right any more than is permissible under clause (6) of that article.\\r\\nThe legislation in the present case has excluded all private bus owners from the field of transport business.\\r\\nPrima facie it is an infraction of the provision of article 19(1) (g) of the Constitution and the question for our consideration therefore is whether this invasion by the Legislature of the fundamental right can be justified under the provision of clause (6) of article 19 on the ground that it imposes reasonable restrictions on the exercise of the right in the interests of the general public.\\r\\n720 Article 19(6) of the Constitution, as it stands after the amendment of 1951, makes a three fold provision by way of exception to or limitation upon clause (1) (g) of the article.\\r\\nIn the first place it empowers the State to impose reasonable restrictions upon the freedom of trade, business, occupation or profession in the interests of the general public.\\r\\nIn the second place it empowers the State to prescribe the professional and technical qualifications necessary for practicing any profession or carrying on any occupation, trade or business.\\r\\nThirdly, and this is the result of the Constitution (First) Amendment Act of 1951 it enables the State to carry on any trade or business either by itself or through a corporation owned or controlled by the State to the exclusion of private citizens wholly or in part.\\r\\nIt is not disputed that the third provision which was introduced by the amendment of the Constitution in 1951 was not in existence when the impugned Act was passed and the High Court rightly held that the validity of the Act is not to be decided by applying the provision of the new clause.\\r\\nThe learned Judges held however that quite apart from the new provision, the creation of a State monopoly in regard to transport service, as has been done under the Act, could be justified as reasonable restrictions upon the fundamental right enunciated in article 19(1) (g) of the Constitution imposed in the interests of the general public.\\r\\nThe question is, whether the view taken by the High Court is right? To answer this question three things will have to be considered.\\r\\nThe first is, whether the expression \"restriction\" as used in article 19(6) and for the matter of that in the other sub clauses of the article, means and includes total deprivation as well? If the answer is in the affirmative, then only the other two questions would arise, namely, whether these restrictions are reasonable and have been imposed in the interests of the general public ? According to the meaning given in the Oxford Dictionary, the word \"restriction\" connotes a \\'limitation \\' imposed upon a person or a thing, a \\'condition or regulation \\' of this nature, though the use of the word in the sense of suppression is not 721 altogether unknown.\\r\\nIn the case of Municipal Corporation of the City of Toronto vs Virgo(1), Lord Davey while discussing a statutory power conferred on a Municipal Council to make bye laws for regulating and governing a trade made the following observation: \" No doubt the regulation and governance of a trade may involve the imposition of restrictions on its exercise. where such restrictions are in the opinion of the public authority necessary to prevent a nuisance or for the maintenance of order.\\r\\nBut their Lordships think that there is a marked distinction to be drawn between the prohibition or prevention of a trade and the regulation or governance of it, and indeed a power to regulate and govern seems to imply the continued existence of that which is to be regulated or governed.\\r\\n\" This line of reasoning receives support from the observations made by some of the learned Judges of this Court in their respective judgments in the case of A. K. Gopalan vs The State (2).\\r\\nThe question for consideration in that case was the constitutional validity of the Preventive Detention Act and one of the contentions raised by the learned counsel for the appellant in attacking the validity of the legislation was, that it invaded the right of free movement guaranteed under article 19(1)(d) of the Constitution ; and as the restrictions imposed by it could not be regarded as reasonable restrictions within the meaning of clause (5) of the article, the enactment should be held to be void.\\r\\nThis argument was repelled by the majority of the Judges inter alia on the ground that a law which authorises the deprivation of personal liberty did not fall within the purview of article 19 and its validity was not to be judge d by the criteria indicated in that article but depended on its compliance with the requirements of articles 21 and 22 of the Constitution.\\r\\nThe expression Personal liberty\" as used in article 21, it was said, was sufficiently comprehensive to include the particular freedoms enumerated in article 19(1) and its deprivation therefore in accordance with the provision of article 21 would result in automatic extinction of the other freedoms also.\\r\\nIn this connection reference was made to (1) ,93.(2) ; 722 the several sub clauses of article 19 and Patanjali Sastri J. expressed his views in the following words: \"The use of the word \\'restrictions \\' in the various sub clauses seems to imply, in the context, that the rights guaranteed by the Article are still capable of being exercised, and to exclude the idea of incarceration though the words \\'restriction and deprivation \\' are sometimes used as inter changeable terms, as restriction may reach a point where it may well amount to deprivation.\\r\\nRead as a whole and viewed in its setting among the group of provisions relating to \\'right to freedom \\', Article 19 seems to my mind to presuppose that the citizen to whom the possession of these fundamental rights is secured retains the substratum of personal freedom on which alone the enjoyment of these rights necessarily rests.\\r\\n\" The point for consideration in that case was undoubtedly different from the one that has arisen in the present case and the question whether the restrictions enumerated in the several sub clauses of article \\' 19 could go to the length of total deprivation of these liberties was neither raised nor decided in that case.\\r\\nBut a distinction was drawn by the majority of learned Judges between negation or deprivation of a right and a restriction upon it and although it was said.\\r\\nthat restriction may reach a point where it might amount to deprivation, yet restrictions would normally pre suppose the continued existence no matter even in a very thin and attenuated form of the thing upon which the restrictions were imposed.\\r\\nKania C.J. in his judgment (vide page 106) expressly said: Therefore Article 19(5) cannot apply to a substantive law depriving a citizen of personal liberty.\\r\\nI am unable to accept the contention that the word \\'deprivation \\' includes within its scope \\'restriction \\' when interpreting Article 21.\\r\\n\" Against this view it may be urged that the use of the words \\'deprivation\" and \"restrictions\" as interchangeable expressions is not altogether unusual in ordinary language and the nature and extent of restrictions might in some cases amount to a negation of the right.\\r\\nThe Orissa, High Court in the care of Lokanath 723 Misra vs The State of Orissa (1) accepted this view and made a distinction between \"regulation\" and \"restriction\".\\r\\nIn the opinion of the learned Judges the observations of Lord Davey in Municipal Corporation of the City of Toronto vs Virgo (supra) referred to above could be distinguished on the ground that the expression used in that article was not \\'restriction \\' but regulation \\' and \\'governing \\'.\\r\\nIt is said that the framers of the Constitution were aware of the distinction between the power to \\'regulate \\' and the power to \\'restrict \\' and this would be apparent from a scrutiny of sub clause \\'a) of clause (2) of article 25 of the Constitution where the words \"regulating\" and \"restricting\" occur in juxtaposition indicating thereby that they were not intended to convey the same meaning.\\r\\nOn behalf of the respondents much reliance has also been placed on a decision of this Court in Cooverjee vs The Excise COMMISSIONER, etc.\\r\\n(2) where the point for consideration was the validity of the Excise Regulation I of 1915.\\r\\nIt was contended, inter alia, on behalf of the appellant in that case that the Excise Regulation and the auction sales made thereunder were ultra vires, as the law purported to grant monopoly of that trade to a few persons and this was inconsistent with article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution.\\r\\nThis contention was negatived and this Court held that for the purpose of determining reasonable restrictions within the meaning of article 19(6) of the Constitution on the right given under article 19(1)(g), regard must be had to the nature of the business and the conditions prevailing in a particular trade.\\r\\nThe State has certainly the right to prohibit trades which are illegal or immoral or injurious to the health and welfare of the public.\\r\\nThe relevant portion of the judgment runs as follows: \" Article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution guarantees that all citizens have the right to practise any profession or to carry on any occupation or trade or business, and clause (6) of the article authorises legislation which imposes reasonable restrictions on this right in the interests of the general public.\\r\\nIt was not disputed that in order to determine the reasonableness (1) A.I.R. 1952 Orissa 42, (2) ; 724 of the restriction regard must be had to the nature of the business and the conditions prevailing in that trade. .\\r\\nIt can also not be denied that the State has the power to prohibit trades which are illegal or immoral or injurious to the health and welfare of the public.\\r\\nLaws prohibiting trades in noxious or dangerous goods or trafficking in women cannot be held to be illegal as enacting a prohibition and not a mere regulation.\\r\\n\" It is contended on behalf of the respondents that these observations clearly indicate that the expression \"reasonable restriction\" as used in article 19(6) of the Constitution might, in certain circumstances, include total prohibition.\\r\\nIt may be mentioned here that the Excise Regulation is not a prohibitory statute which prohibits trading in liquor by private citizens altogether.\\r\\nIt purports to regulate the trade in a particular way, namely, by putting up the right of trading in liquor in specified areas to the highest bidder in auction sale.\\r\\nThe general observations occurring in the judgment cited above must therefore have to be taken with reference to the facts of that case. \\' Be that as it may, although in our opinion the normal use of the word \"restriction\" seems, to be in the sense of \"limitation\" and not \"extinction\", we would on this occasion prefer not to express any final opinion on this matter.\\r\\nIf the word, \"restriction\" does not include total prohibition then the law under review cannot be justified under article 19(6).\\r\\nIn that case the law would be void unless it can be supported by article 31.\\r\\nThat point will be dealt with under the other point raised in the appeal.\\r\\nIf however the word \"restriction\" in article 19(6) of the Constitution be taken in certain circumstances to include prohibition as well, the point for consideration then would be, whether the prohibition of the right of all private citizens to carry on the business of motor transport on public roads within the State of Uttar Pradesh as laid down by the Act can be justified as reasonable restrictions imposed in the interests of the general public.\\r\\nAs has been held by this Court in the case of Gooverjee vs The Excise, Commissioner, etc.(1) whether (I) ; 725 the restrictions are reasonable or not would depend to a large extent on the nature of the trade and the conditions prevalent in it.\\r\\nThere in nothing wrong in the nature of the trade before us, which is perfectly innocuous.\\r\\nThe learned Judges of the High Court have upheld the validity of the legislation substantially on two grounds.\\r\\nIn the first place, they have relied on what may be said to be an abstract proposition of law, that prohibition with a view to State monopoly is not per se unreasonable.\\r\\n\"In my opinion\", thus observes one of the learned Judges, \"even this total stoppage of trade on public places and thoroughfares cannot always be said to be an unreasonable restriction\".\\r\\nIn the second place, it has been said that the transport services are essential to the life of the community and it is conducive to the interests of the general public to have an efficient system of transport on public roads.\\r\\nIt is pointed out that the preamble to the Act indicates that the legislation was \\' passed in the interests of the general public who are undoubtedly interested in a suitable and efficient road transport service, and it was not proved by the petitioners that the monopoly, which was contemplated in favour of the State in regard to this particular business, was not conducive to the common welfare.\\r\\nAs a proposition of law, the first ground may not admit of any dispute but we think that the observations of Lord Porter in the Privy Council case of Commonwealth of Australia and Others vs Bank of New South Wales and Others (1) upon which considerable reliance has been placed by the High Court would indicate the proper way of approach to this question \\' \"Their Lordships do not intend to lay it down\", thus observed Lord Porter, \"that in no circumstances could the exclusion of competition so as to create a monopoly either in a State or Commonwealth agency or in some other body be justified.\\r\\nEvery case must be judged,on its own facts and in its own setting of time and circumstance, and it may be that in regard to some economic activities and at some stage of social development it might be maintained that prohibition with a view to State monopoly was the only practical and reasonable (1) , 311.93 726 manner of regulation\".\\r\\nIn order to judge whether State monopoly is reasonable or not, regard therefore must be had to the facts of each particular case in its own setting of time and circumstances.\\r\\nIt is not enough to say that as an efficient transport service is conducive to the interests of the people, a legislation which makes provision for such service must always be held valid irrespective of the fact as to what the effect of such legislation would be and irrespective of the particular conditions and circumstances under which the legislation was passed.\\r\\nIt is not enough that the restrictions are for the benefit of the public, they must be reasonable as well and the reasonableness could be decided only on a conspectus of all the relevant facts and circumstances.\\r\\nWith regard to the second point also we do not think that the learned Judges have approached the question from the proper stand point.\\r\\nThere is undoubtedly a presumption in favour of the constitutionality of a legislation.\\r\\nBut when the enactment on the face of it is found to violate a fundamental right guaranteed under article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution, it must be held to be invalid unless those who support the legislation can bring it within the purview of the exception laid down in clause (6) of the article.\\r\\nIf the respondents do not place any materials before the Court to establish that the legislation comes within the permis sible limits of clause (6), it is surely not for the appel lants to prove negatively that the legislation was not reasonable and was not conducive to the welfare of the community.\\r\\nIn the present case we have absolutely no materials before us to say in which way the establishment of State monopoly in regard to road transport service in the particular areas would be conducive to the general welfare of the public.\\r\\nWe do not know the conditions of the bus service at the present moment or the conveniences or inconveniences of the public in regard to the same; nor we are told how the position is likely to improve if the State takes over the road transport service and what additional amenities or advantages the general public would enjoy in that event.\\r\\nWe mention these matters only to show 727 that these are relevant facts which might help the Court in coming to a decision as to the reasonableness or otherwise of the prohibition, but unfortunately there are no materials in the record relating to any one of them.\\r\\nOne thing, however, in our opinion, has a decided bearing on the question of reasonableness and that is the immediate effect which the legislation is likely to produce.\\r\\nHundreds of citizens are earning their livelihood by carrying on this business on various routes within the State of Uttar Pradesh.\\r\\nAlthough they carry on the business only with the aid of permits, which are granted to them by the authorities under the Motor Vehicles Act, no compensation has been allowed to them under the statute.\\r\\nIt goes without saying that as a result of the Act they will all be deprived of the means of supporting themselves and their families and they will be left with their buses which will be of no further use to them and which they may not be able to dispose of easily or at a reasonable price.\\r\\nIt may be pointed out in this connection that in Part IV of the Constitution which enunciates the directive principles of State policy, article 39(a) expressly lays down that the State shall direct its policy towards securing \"that the citizens, men and women equally, have the right to an adequate means of livelihood.\\r\\n\" The new clause in article 19(6) has no doubt been introduced with a view to provide that a State can create a monopoly in its own favour in respect of any trade or business; but the amendment does not make the establishment of such monopoly a reasonable restriction within the meaning of the first clause of article 19(6).\\r\\nThe result of the amendment is that the State would not have to justify such action as reasonable at all in a Court of law and no objection could be taken to it on the ground that it is an infringement of the right guaranteed under article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution.\\r\\nIt is quite true that if the present statute was passed after the coming into force of the new clause in article 19(6) of the Constitution, the question of reasonableness would not have arisen at all and the appellants \\' case on this point, at any rate, would have been inarguable.\\r\\nThese are however 728 considerations which cannot affect our decision in the present case.\\r\\nThe amendment of the Constitution, which came later, cannot be invoked to validate an earlier legislation which must be regarded as unconstitutional when it was passed: As Professor Cooley has stated in his work on Constitutional Limitations(1) \"a statute void for u`constitutionality is dead and cannot be vitalised by a subsequent amendment of the Constitution removing the constitutional objection but must be re enacted\".\\r\\nWe think that this is sound law and our conclusion is that the legislation in question which violates the fundamental right of the appellants under article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution and is not shown to be protected by clause (6) of the article, as it stood at the time of the enactment, must be held to be void under article 13(2) of the Constitution.\\r\\nWe now come to the second point which is in a manner connected with the first and the question is: If the effect of prohibition of the trade or business of the appellants by the impugned legislation amounts to deprivation of their property or interest in a commercial undertaking within the meaning of article 31(2) of the Constitution, does not the legislation offend against the provision of that clause inasmuch as no provision for compensation has been made in the Act ? It is not seriously disputed on behalf of the respondents that the appellants \\' right to ply motor vehicles for gain is, in any event, an interest in a commercial undertaking.\\r\\nThere is no doubt also that the appellants have been deprived of this interest.\\r\\nIn the opinion of the High Court, in the circumstances of the present case, there is no scope for operation of article 31(2) of the Con stitution and the reason for taking this view is thus given in the judgment of one of the learned Judges: \"The question is whether by depriving the private operators of their right to run buses on certain routes and by deciding to run the routes itself the State acquired the right which was of the petitioners ? To me it appears that it could not be said that there was by the State any acquisition of the right which was formerly of the petitioners, whether such right was (1) VOl.729 property or an interest in a commercial or industrial undertaking.\\r\\nThe vehicles which were being operated by the private operators have not been acquired by the State nor has any other tangible property which was used by the petitioners for their business been acquired.\\r\\nWhat has been done is that the petitioners have been prohibited from operating their buses on certain routes.\\r\\nThis right of the petitioners has in no way been vested in the State inasmuch as the State always had an equal right with the petitioners to run their buses on these routes.\\r\\n\" According to the High Court, therefore, mere depriv ation of the petitioners \\' right to run buses or their interest in a commercial undertaking is not sufficient to attract the operation of article 31(2) of the Constitution as the deprivation has been by the authority of law within the meaning of clause (1) of that article.\\r\\nClause (2) could be attracted only if the State had acquired or taken possession of this very right or interest of the petitioners or in other words if the right of the petitioners to run buses had been acquired by or had become vested in the Government.\\r\\nThe State, it is pointed out, has an undoubted right to run buses of its own on the public thoroughfares, and they do not stand on the rights of the petitioners.\\r\\nThis argument, we think, is not tenable having regard to the majority decision of this Court in the case of State of West Bengal vs Subodh Gopal Bose and Others (1) and Dwarkadas Shrinivas vs The Sholapur Spinning and Weaving Co. Ltd. (2).\\r\\nIn view of that majority decision it must be taken to be settled now that clauses (1) and (2) of article 31 are not mutually exclusive in scope but should be read together as dealing with the same subject, namely, the protection of the right to property by means of limitations on the State \\'s powers, the deprivation contemplated in clause (1) being no other than acquisition or taking possession of the property referred to in clause (2).\\r\\nThe learned Advocate General co n. needed this to be the true legal position after the pronouncements of this Court referred to above.\\r\\nThe fact that the buses belonging to the appellants have (1) ; (2) ; 730 not been acquired by the Government is also not material.\\r\\nThe property of a business may be both tangible and intangible.\\r\\nUnder the statute the Government may not deprive the appellants of their buses or any other tangible property but they are depriving them of the business of running buses on hire on public roads.\\r\\nWe think therefore that in these circumstances the legislation does conflict with the provision of article 31(2) of the Constitution and as the requirements of that clause have not been complied with, it should be held to be invalid on that ground.\\r\\nThe next point that requires consideration is, whether the Act or any of its provisions are discriminatory in their character and conflict with the rule of equal protection embodied in article 14 of the Constitution ? Mr. Pathak has raised a two fold contention on this point.\\r\\nHe has argued in the first place that no discrimination could be made in favour of the State as against private individuals in the matter of carrying on the business of plying buses for hire on public roads.\\r\\nThe State as a person, it is conceded, comes under a different class or category from private citizens; but the contention is that when the State carries on trade as merchants it occupies the same position as private traders and its acts in this respect cannot be regarded as acts of the sovereign.\\r\\nMuch reliance has been placed by the learned counsel in sup port of this view on the judgment of Sir Barnes Peacock in P. and O. Steam Navigation Co. vs The Secretary of State(1).\\r\\nThe other objection taken by the learned counsel is, that the Act gives an unguided and unfettered discretion to the State to associate such persons as it likes in the transport business and thereby allows it to discriminate between one citizen and another.\\r\\nNo rules are laid down to regulate the choice of the State in such cases.\\r\\nSo far as the first ground is concerned, it is well settled that mere differentiation does not make a legislation obnoxious to the equal protection clause.\\r\\nThe Legislature has always the power to make classification and all that is necessary is that the classification should not be arbitrary but must bear a reasonable (1) (1861) 5 B.H.C.R.Appendix 1. 731 relation to the object which the legislation has in view.\\r\\nThere is no doubt that classification is inherent in the concept of a monopoly; and if the object of legislation is to create monopoly in favour of the State with regard to a particular business, obviously the State cannot but be differentiated from ordinary citizens and placed in a separate category so far as the running of the business is concerned and this classification would have a perfectly rational relation to the object of the statute.\\r\\nNo doubt if the creation of a monopoly in favour of the State is itself bad on the ground of violating some constitutional provisions, the statute would be invalid for those reasons and the question of discrimination would not be material at all.\\r\\nIn our opinion, the argument of Mr. Pathak that the State ceases to function as a State as soon as it engages itself in a trade like ordinary trader cannot be accepted as a sound proposition of law under the Constitution of India at the present day.\\r\\nIn the last century, when the laissez faire doctrine held the field, the primary function of a State was considered to be maintenance of law and order and all other activities were left to private competitors.\\r\\nThat conception is now changed and in place of the \\'police State \\' of old, we are now having a \\'welfare State. \\' Chapter IV of our Constitution which lays down the Directive Principles of State Policy clearly indicates what the functions of a State should be and many things which could not have been considered as State functions when the case of P. and 0.\\r\\nSteam Navigation Co. vs The Secretary of State (Supra), was decided would certainly come within the legitimate scope of State duties Vide in this connection Lokanath Misra vs State of Orissa(supra).\\r\\nThe other contention of Mr. Pathak in regard to article 14 though somewhat plausible at first sight does not appear to us to be sound.\\r\\nSection 3 of the Act authorises the State Government to declare that the road transport service in general or on particular routes should be run and operated by the State Government exclusively or by the State Government in conjunction with railway or partly by the State Government and partly by others in accordance with the provisions of 732 the Act The whole question is how is the last part of the section to be implemented and carried out? If the State can choose any and every person it likes for the purpose of being associated with the transport service and there are no rules to guide its discretion, plainly the provision would offend against article 14 of the Constitution.\\r\\nThe learned Advocate General pointed out however that the State is only to choose the routes or portions of routes on which the private citizens would be allowed to operate and the number of persons to whom permits should be given, and that the granting of permits would necessarily be regulated by the provisions of Motor Vehicles Act.\\r\\nThis does not appear to us to be an unreasonable construction to be put upon the relevant portion of section 3 of the Act and it receives support from what is laid down in section 7(c) of the Act.\\r\\nOn this construction the discretion to be exercised by the State would be a regulated discretion guided by statutory rules.\\r\\nWe hold therefore that the appellant cannot make any grievance on this score and that the statute does not offend against article 14 of the Constitution.\\r\\nThe last point that remains to be considered is, whether the Act conflicts with the guarantee of freedom of inter State and intrastate trade, commerce and intercourse provided for by article 301 of the Constitution ? Article 301 runs as follows: \" Subject to the other provisions of this Part, trade \\' commerce and intercourse throughout the territory of India shall be free.\\r\\n\" Article 302 authorises the Parliament to impose such restrictions on the freedom of trade, commerce and intercourse between one State and another or within any part of the territory of India as may be required in the public interests.\\r\\nUnder article 304(b) it is competent even for the Legislature of a State to impose reasonable restrictions upon the freedom of trade, commerce and intercourse mentioned above in the interests of the public, but it is necessary that any bill or amendment for this purpose should first receive the sanction of the President before it is moved or introduced in the Legislature of a State.\\r\\nArticle 301 733 corresponds to section 92 of the Australian Constitution and is even wider than the latter inasmuch as the Australian Constitution provides for the freedom of inter State trade only.\\r\\nThe High Court has negatived the contention of the appellants on this point primarily on the ground that article 301 of the Constitution has no application to the present case.\\r\\nWhat is said is, that article 301 provides safeguards for carrying on trade as a whole as distinguished from the rights of an individual to carry it on.\\r\\nIn other words, this article is concerned with the passage of commodities or persons either within or outside the State frontiers but not directly with individuals carrying on the commerce or trade.\\r\\nThe right of individuals, it is said, is dealt with under article 19(1) (g) of the Constitution and the two articles have been framed in order to secure two different, objects.\\r\\nThe question is not quite free from difficulty and in view of the fact that we have declared the Act to be unconstitutional on the two grounds mentioned above, we do not consider it necessary to record our decision on this point.\\r\\nWe would only desire \\'to indicate the contentions that have been or could be raised upon this point and the different views that are possible to be taken in respect to them so that the Legislature might take these matters into consideration if and when they think of legislating on this subject.\\r\\nWe desire to point out that in regard to section 92 of the Australian Constitution, which so far as inter.\\r\\nState trade is concerned adopts almost the same language as article 301 of our Constitution, it has been definitely held by the Judicial Committee in the case of Commonwealth of Australia vs The Bank of New South Wales (supra), that the rights of individuals do come within the purview of the section.\\r\\nIt is true, as Lord Porter observed, that section 92 does not create any new juristic rights but it does give the citizens of the State or the Commonwealth, as the case may be, the right to ignore and, if necessary, to call on the judicial power to help him to resist legislative or executive actions which offend against the section.\\r\\nIt follows from this, as his Lordship pointed out, that 94 734 the application of section 92 does not involve calculations as to the actual present or possible future effect upon the total value of inter State trade, the difficulty in applying such a criterion being too obvious.\\r\\nIf this view is adopted in regard to article 301 of our Constitution it can plausibly be argued that the legislation in the present case is invalid as contravening the terms of the article.\\r\\nThe question of reasonable restrictions could not also arise in this case, as the bill was not introduced with the previous sanction of the President as required by the proviso to section 304(b).\\r\\nIt is true that the consent of the President was taken subsequently but the proviso expressly insists on the sanction being taken previous to the introduction of the bill.\\r\\nIt may be argued that freedom of trade does not, as Lord Porter observed in the Australian Bank case referred to above, mean unrestricted or unrestrained freedom and that regulation of trade is quite compatible with its freedom.\\r\\nAs against this it may be pointed out that the Constitution itself has provided in articles 302 and 304(b) how reasonable restrictions could be imposed upon freedom of trade and commerce and it would not be proper to hold that restrictions can be imposed aliunde these provisions in the Constitution.\\r\\nThe question would also arise as to what interpretation should be put upon the expression \"reasonable restrictions\" and whether or not we would have to apply the same tests as we have applied in regard to article 19(6) of the Constitution.\\r\\nOne material thing to consider in this connection would be that although the Constitution was amended in 1951 by insertion of an additional clause in article 19(6) by which State monopoly in regard to trade or business was taken out of the purview of article 19(1) (g) of the Constitution, yet no such addition was made in article 301 or article 304 of the Constitution and article 301, as it stands, guarantees freedom of trade, commerce and intercourse subject only to Part XIII of the Constitution and not the other parts of the Constitution including that dealing with fundamental rights.\\r\\n735 The Australian Constitution indeed has no provision like article 19(1) (g) of the Indian Constitution and it is certainly an arguable point as to whether the rights of individuals alone are dealt with in article 19(1) (g) of the Constitution leaving the freedom of trade and commerce, meaning by that expression \\'only the free passage of persons and goods \\' within or without a State to be dealt with under article 301 and the following articles.\\r\\nWe have thus indicated only the points that could be raised and the possible views that could be taken but as we have said already, we do not desire to express any final opinion on these points as it is unnecessary for purposes of the present case.\\r\\nThe result is that in our opinion the appeals should be allowed and the judgment of the High Court set aside A writ in the nature of mandamus shall issue against the respondents in these appeals restraining them from enforcing the provisions of the U. P. State Road Transport Act, 1951, against the appellants or the men working under them.\\r\\nThere will be no order as to costs.\\r\\nAppeals allowed.\\r\\n', {'entities': [[8, 33, 'CASE_NUMBER'], [49, 63, 'PROVISION'], [132, 151, 'DATE'], [160, 184, 'COURT'], [188, 197, 'GPE'], [226, 241, 'CASE_NUMBER'], [289, 399, 'CASE_NUMBER'], [416, 477, 'CASE_NUMBER'], [496, 513, 'LAWYER'], [515, 529, 'LAWYER'], [534, 544, 'LAWYER'], [577, 588, 'LAWYER'], [624, 628, 'GPE'], [634, 648, 'LAWYER'], [650, 665, 'LAWYER'], [670, 679, 'LAWYER'], [714, 725, 'DATE'], [770, 779, 'JUDGE'], [953, 964, 'GPE'], [965, 970, 'GPE'], [1071, 1097, 'STATUTE'], [1296, 1309, 'PROVISION'], [1534, 1555, 'ORG'], [1613, 1618, 'GPE'], [2047, 2060, 'PROVISION'], [2565, 2576, 'PROVISION'], [2717, 2735, 'STATUTE'], [2743, 2762, 'ORG'], [3008, 3021, 'PROVISION'], [3029, 3047, 'STATUTE'], [3266, 3276, 'PROVISION'], [3509, 3522, 'PROVISION'], [3738, 3756, 'STATUTE'], [4101, 4142, 'STATUTE'], [4189, 4212, 'DATE'], [4356, 4374, 'STATUTE'], [4636, 4645, 'PROVISION'], [4688, 4697, 'PROVISION'], [5303, 5312, 'PROVISION'], [5489, 5501, 'PROVISION'], [5585, 5595, 'PROVISION'], [6271, 6287, 'PROVISION'], [6387, 6397, 'PROVISION'], [6504, 6514, 'PROVISION'], [6655, 6665, 'PROVISION'], [6819, 6838, 'DATE'], [6844, 6860, 'ORG'], [6897, 6906, 'ORG'], [6989, 7005, 'GPE'], [7114, 7126, 'DATE'], [7407, 7418, 'PROVISION'], [7534, 7550, 'ORG'], [7559, 7586, 'ORG'], [7776, 7795, 'STATUTE'], [7994, 8004, 'STATUTE'], [8112, 8122, 'STATUTE'], [8355, 8365, 'STATUTE'], [8513, 8524, 'STATUTE'], [8635, 8643, 'JUDGE'], [8648, 8658, 'JUDGE'], [8715, 8737, 'DATE'], [9350, 9363, 'DATE'], [9550, 9560, 'DATE'], [9692, 9705, 'DATE'], [9984, 10000, 'PROVISION'], [10154, 10167, 'PROVISION'], [12098, 12111, 'PROVISION'], [13545, 13572, 'OTHERS'], [17469, 17512, 'PRECEDENT'], [17540, 17557, 'JUDGE'], [18805, 18813, 'JUDGE'], [19108, 19121, 'JUDGE'], [20446, 20459, 'PROVISION'], [20605, 20615, 'PROVISION'], [20797, 20810, 'PROVISION'], [20993, 21003, 'PROVISION'], [21146, 21159, 'PROVISION'], [21294, 21304, 'PROVISION'], [22514, 22527, 'PROVISION'], [22797, 22810, 'PROVISION'], [24324, 24354, 'PRECEDENT'], [24440, 24464, 'STATUTE'], [24650, 24663, 'PROVISION'], [25196, 25214, 'PROVISION'], [25281, 25291, 'PROVISION'], [25386, 25399, 'PROVISION'], [25466, 25476, 'PROVISION'], [25629, 25639, 'PROVISION'], [25644, 25660, 'JUDGE'], [26199, 26209, 'PROVISION'], [26629, 26641, 'PROVISION'], [27156, 27166, 'JUDGE'], [27225, 27238, 'JUDGE'], [27440, 27451, 'JUDGE'], [27728, 27746, 'COURT'], [27762, 27803, 'PRECEDENT'], [27962, 28015, 'PRECEDENT'], [28397, 28407, 'PROVISION'], [29059, 29072, 'PROVISION'], [29230, 29243, 'PROVISION'], [29289, 29302, 'PROVISION'], [29603, 29616, 'PROVISION'], [29767, 29777, 'PROVISION'], [29979, 30000, 'PRECEDENT'], [30591, 30604, 'PROVISION'], [31485, 31498, 'PROVISION'], [31566, 31577, 'PROVISION'], [31691, 31704, 'PROVISION'], [32152, 32190, 'PRECEDENT'], [33690, 33753, 'PRECEDENT'], [35556, 35569, 'PROVISION'], [35727, 35737, 'PROVISION'], [35892, 35902, 'PROVISION'], [37325, 37343, 'STATUTE'], [37834, 37847, 'PROVISION'], [38039, 38052, 'PROVISION'], [38329, 38342, 'PROVISION'], [38577, 38590, 'PROVISION'], [38721, 38734, 'PROVISION'], [39566, 39579, 'PROVISION'], [39639, 39649, 'PROVISION'], [39738, 39751, 'PROVISION'], [40076, 40089, 'PROVISION'], [40618, 40631, 'PROVISION'], [41881, 41894, 'PROVISION'], [41989, 41999, 'PROVISION'], [42018, 42028, 'PROVISION'], [42655, 42675, 'ORG'], [43749, 43762, 'PROVISION'], [44085, 44095, 'PROVISION'], [44816, 44862, 'PRECEDENT'], [47385, 47395, 'PROVISION'], [47473, 47482, 'PROVISION'], [48127, 48137, 'PROVISION'], [48477, 48496, 'STATUTE'], [48599, 48608, 'PROVISION'], [48670, 48679, 'PROVISION'], [49159, 49170, 'PROVISION'], [49193, 49204, 'PROVISION'], [49355, 49366, 'PROVISION'], [49597, 49611, 'PROVISION'], [49978, 49989, 'PROVISION'], [50009, 50019, 'PROVISION'], [50283, 50294, 'PROVISION'], [50378, 50389, 'PROVISION'], [50768, 50781, 'PROVISION'], [51584, 51595, 'PROVISION'], [51869, 51879, 'PROVISION'], [52245, 52255, 'PROVISION'], [52481, 52492, 'PROVISION'], [52815, 52829, 'PROVISION'], [53318, 53330, 'PROVISION'], [53742, 53755, 'PROVISION'], [53928, 53941, 'PROVISION'], [54029, 54042, 'PROVISION'], [54101, 54112, 'PROVISION'], [54116, 54127, 'PROVISION'], [54152, 54163, 'PROVISION'], [54433, 54446, 'PROVISION'], [54580, 54593, 'PROVISION'], [54783, 54794, 'PROVISION'], [55323, 55359, 'STATUTE']]}]\n",

Nos.\\r\\n372 of 1943 and 634 of 1944 which were appeals from the orders of the Subordinate Judge of Ellore in E.A. No. 440 of 1937 and C.M.P. No. 152 of 1943 in O.S. No. 87 of 1923.\\r\\nP. Somasundaram (V. V. Choudhry, with him) for the appellant.\\r\\nV. Rangachari (K. Mangachari, with him) for the respond ents. 1950.\\r\\nOctober 17.\\r\\nThe Court delivered judgment as follows.\\r\\nFAZL ALI J.\\r\\nThese appeals arise out of an execution proceeding, and the main point to be decided in them is what is the effect of certain provisions of the Madras Agricul turists \\' Relief Act (Madras Act IV of 1938, which will hereinafter be referred to as \"the Madras Act\"), on the rights of the parties.\\r\\nHow this point arises will be clear from a brief statement of the facts of the case.\\r\\nIt appears that in 1908, one Veeresalingam, the husband of the first respondent, borrowed a sum of Rs. 9,000 from one Sitharamayya, and executed a mortgage bond in his fa vour.\\r\\nSubsequently a suit was 808 instituted by the mortgagee to enforce the mortgage and a final decree in that suit was passed on the 19th August, 1926.\\r\\nThereafter, on the 28th October, 1931,the decree holder applied for the execution of the decree by the sale of the mortgaged property.\\r\\nIn 193a, the decree holder transferred the decree to one Sobhanadri, after whose death his son, the appellant before us, was brought on the record as his legal representative in the execution proceedings.\\r\\nSeveral years before the assignment of the decree, Veeresa lingam, the defendant, had died and his widow, the first respondent.\\r\\nwas therefore brought on the record as his legal representative.\\r\\nOn the 6th July, 1935, two items of proper ty were sold in execution of the decree and purchased by the decree holder, these being : (1) a village called Tedlam in in West Godavari District; and (2) 4 acres and 64 cents of land in Madepalli village.\\r\\nThe first property was sold for Rs. 21,000 and the second for \\' Rs. 1,025.\\r\\nAs, however, the amount due under the decree was only about Rs. 17,860 and odd, the sale of the second property was subsequently set aside and the decree holder deposited into Court the excess amount of about Rs. 3,000 and odd after setting off the decretal amount against the price of the first item of property.\\r\\nOn the 5th August, 1935, the first respondent filed an application under Order XXI, rule 90, and section 47 of the Code of Civil Procedure, to set aside the sale held in July, 1935, alleging certain irregularities in the conduct of the sale.\\r\\nThat application was after several years heard by the Subordinate Judge of Ellore, who by his order dated the 6th March, 1943, dismissed it and directed the sale of the first property to be confirmed and full satisfaction of the decree to be entered.\\r\\nAfter about 12 days, i.e., on the 18th March, 1943, the first respondent and the second respondent, who had been adopted by the former on the 12th March, 1936, under the will of her hus band and was subsequently brought on record, filed an appli cation under section 19 of the Madras Act praying for cer tain reliefs under that Act.\\r\\nThis application \\' was dismissed on the 22nd March, 1943.\\r\\nSubsequently, two appeals were filed on behalf 809 of the respondents (who will hereinafter be sometimes re ferred to as judgment debtors), one against the order refus ing to set aside the sale under Order XXI, rule 90 of the Civil Procedure Code, and the other against the order dis missing the application under the Madras Act.\\r\\nThese appeals were heard together by two learned Judges of the Madras High Court and they took the view that the judgment debtors \\' application under the Madras Act was maintainable notwith standing the fact that the sale had been confirmed and full satisfaction of the decree recorded, and remitted the case to the trial Court for a finding on the following questions, namely (1) whether the applicants were agriculturists; and (2) if so, what would be the result of applying the provisions of Madras Act IV of 1938 to the decretal debt against them ? So far as regards the judgment debtors \\' appeal against the order dismissing their application under Order XXI, rule 90, the Learned Judges were inclined to agree with the trial Court that the sale should stand but declined to pass final orders in the appeal on the ground that \"it would seriously prejudice the judgment debtors in the connected application for relief under section 19 of the Madras Act IV of 1938.\\r\\n\" The Subordinate Judge answered the questions referred to him by the High Court on remand as follows : (1) The judgment debtors were not agriculturists and were not therefore entitled to the benefits of the Madras Act;and (2) If they were agriculturists, they were not liable to pay anything under the decree, as, in view of the provisions of the Act, the debt stood discharged on the date of sale.\\r\\nWhen however the matter came up before the learned Judges of the High Court, they reversed the first finding of the trial Court and held that the judgmentdebtors were agriculturists within the meaning of the 810 Act, and that the debt stood discharged in view of section 8 (2) of the Act.\\r\\nAt the same time, they held that the sale was not liable to be set aside, and in this view dismissed one of the appeals and allowed the other.\\r\\nThen followed certain proceedings to which it would have been unnecessary to refer but for the fact that the judgment debtors have attempted to rely on \"them in support of one of their preliminary objections to the maintainability of these appeals.\\r\\nIt appears that on the next day after the judgment of the High Court was delivered in the two appeals, counsel for the respondents wrote a letter to the Registrar of the High Court to direct the posting of the two cases \\'for being mentioned \\' before the Court in order to obtain necessary directions consequent on the orders passed by it in the appeals.\\r\\nThis letter was not placed before the learned Judges until the judgment had been signed by them and ac cordingly the judgment debtors filed two petitions, one being a review petition to the High Court and the other being a petition to the trial Court praying \"that the de creeholder may be ordered to pay to the petitioners the purchase money of Rs. 21,000 with interest thereon at 6 per cent.\\r\\nper annum from the date of sale till the date of payment.\\r\\n\" The trial Court dismissed the latter petition on the ground that it was not maintainable, and the judgment debtors filed an appeal against the order.\\r\\nThe appeal as well as the review petition of the judgment debtors were heard together by the learned Judges who directed the decree holder \\'s counsel to elect whether his client would deposit the purchase money into Court or have the sale set aside.\\r\\nThe decree holder applied for a short adjournment and ultimately on the 15th November, 1946, his counsel stated that his client wished to retain the property which he had purchased and to pay the purchase money into Court.\\r\\nThereupon, he was directed to pay the sum of Rs. 21,000 together with interest within a months from that date.\\r\\nSubsequently, the appellant (decree holder) having obtained leave to appeal from the High Court preferred 811 these appeals before us.\\r\\nIt may be stated here that along with the application for leave to appeal, the appellant had filed an application for excusing the delay in filing the former application which he accounted for mainly by refer ring to the proceedings for the review of the judgments in the previous appeals to the High Court.\\r\\nThis application was granted and the delay was condoned.\\r\\nAs has been already stated, the main point arising in these appeals relates to the effect of the Madras Act upon this litigation.\\r\\nThat Act was passed and came into effect in 1938, while the execution proceedings were still continu ing.\\r\\nIt will be recalled that the sale took place on the 6th July, 1935; and the application for setting it aside was not disposed of until the 6th March, 1943.\\r\\nBut, strangely enough, the judgmentdebtors did not apply for any relief under the Madras Act during this period, and they made their application only after the sale had been confirmed and satisfaction of the decree had been entered.\\r\\nHow far this belated application affects the right claimed by the judg ment debtors under the Act is one of the questions raised in these appeals, and I shall deal with it after referring to the material provisions of the Act and the findings of the High Court which have given rise to several debatable points.\\r\\nThe sections of the Act which are material for the purpose of these appeals are sections 3, 8 and 19.\\r\\nSection 3 defines an agriculturist and has a proviso stating that in certain cases a person shall not be deemed to be an agricul turist.\\r\\nThe relevant clause of this proviso, to which I shall also have to advert later, is clause (D) which runs thus : \"Provided that a person shall not be deemed to be an \\'agriculturist \\' if he (D) is a landholder of an estate under the Madras Es tates Land Act, 1908, or of a share or portion thereof in respect of which estate, share or portion any sum exceeding Rs. 500 is paid as peshkash or any sum exceeding Rs. 100 is paid as quit rent, jodi, kattubadi, 812 poruppu or the like or is a janmi under the Malabar Tenancy Act, 1929, who pays any sum exceeding Rs. 500 as land reve nue to the Provincial Government. \\' \\' The precise question which is said to arise with refer ence to this provision is whether by reason of being the owners of village Tedlam, the judgment debtors should be held to be not entitled to relief under the Act.\\r\\nThe other material sections 8 and 19 run as follows : \"8.\\r\\nDebts incurred before the 1st October, 1932, shall be scaled down in the manner mentioned hereunder, namely: (1) All interest outstanding on the 1st October, 1937, in favour of any creditor of an agriculturist whether the same be payable under law, custom or contract or under a decree of Court and whether the debt or other obligation has ripened into a decree or not, shall be deemed to be dis charged, and only the principal or such portion thereof as may be outstanding shall be deemed to be the amount repay able by the agriculturist on that date.\\r\\n(2) Where an agriculturist has paid to any creditor twice the amount of the principal whether by way of princi pal or interest or both, such debt including the principal, shall be deemed to be wholly discharged.\\r\\n(3) Where the sums repaid by way of principal or inter est or both fall short of twice the amount of the principal, such amount only as would make up this shortage, or the principal amount or such portion of the principal amount as is outstanding, whichever is smaller, shall be repayable.\\r\\n(4) Subject to the provisions of sections 22 to 25, nothing contained in sub sections (1), (2) and (8) shall be deemed to require the creditor to refund any sum which has been paid to him, or to increase the liability of a debtor to pay any sum in excess of the amount which would have been payable by him if this Act had not been passed.\\r\\n813 Explanation.\\r\\nWhere a debt has been renewed or included in a fresh document in favour of the same creditor, the principal originally advanced by the creditor together with such sums, if any, as have been subsequently advanced as principal shall alone be treated as the principal sum repay able by the agriculturist under this section.\\r\\nWhere \\' before the commencement of this Act, a Court has passed a decree for the repayment of a debt, it shall, on the application of any judgmentdebtor who is an agricul turist or in respect of a Hindu joint family debt, on the application of any member of the family whether or not he is the judgment debtor or on the application of the decree holder, apply the provisions of this Act to such decree and shall, notwithstanding anything contained in the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, amend the decree accordingly or enter satisfaction, as the case may be: Provided that all payments made or amounts recovered, whether before or after the commencement of this Act, in respect of any such decree shall first be applied in payment of all costs as originally decreed to the creditor.\\r\\n\" These sections are material, because in the present case the judgment debtors asked the decree to be amended under section 19 of the Act and they were held to be entitled to relief under section 8.\\r\\nHaving referred to the relevant provisions of the Act, it becomes necessary now to state the main findings of the High Court upon which the decision of this appeal will turn.\\r\\nThese findings are (1) that the sale of Tedlam village, which was held on the 6th July, 1935, and confirmed on the 6th March, 19 13, was a good sale; (2) that by this sale.\\r\\nthe title to the Tedlain village passed to the decree hoMer.\\r\\nand in hearing the appeal the High Court was justified in proceeding on the footing that the judgment debtors having ceased to be the owners of Tedlam village after its sale, were not 104 814 hit by clause (D) of the proviso to section a of the Act; and (3) that the decree had been satisfied at the date of the sale and the decree holder was liable to repay to the judg ment debtors the full price of the property which was sold.\\r\\nThe main contentions directed against the conclusions arrived at by the High Court are :firstly, that they are self contradictory, because if the sale was an effective sale on the date it was held or confirmed, the decree was also satisfied on that date and the judgmentdebtors were no longer entitled to invoke the provisions of the Madras Act; and secondly, that the view taken by the learned Judges of the High Court that notwithstanding the appeal against the order refusing to set aside the sale they could proceed on the footing that the judgment debtors had ceased to be the owners of Tedlarn village on the date of the sale was un sound in law.\\r\\nIt will first deal with the second point which appears to me to require serious consideration.\\r\\nThe High Court has in my opinion rightly proceeded on the footing that the ownership of Tedlam village would bring the judgment debtors within the mischief of clause (D) of the proviso to section 3 of the Act, and would disentitle them to any relief thereunder.\\r\\nThis view was contested before us on behalf of the judgment debtors on two grounds : (1) that the grant in favour of the ancestor of the judgment debtors did not comprise a whole inam village and what they owned was therefore not an estate under the Madras Estates Land Act (Madras Act I of 1908); (2) that on the date of the application, the judg ment debtxrs were not landholders of village Tedlam because the village was in the possession of a receiver since 1st February, 1937, and the latter was in law the landholder on the crucial date.\\r\\nNone of these contentions however appears to me to have any force.\\r\\nThe first contention was sought to be supported by Exhibit P 1 which is a register of inams and which shows that poramboke or waste lands to the extent of 596 acres had to be deducted from the area 815 of the inam.\\r\\nThe point however has been dealt with very fully and clearly by the learned Subordinate Judge, who has rightly pointed out that it has no force in view of the Madras Estates Land (Amendment) Act, 1945 [Madras Act No. II of 1945].\\r\\nThe second point is equally unsubstantial, be cause it is well settled that the owner of a property does not cease to be its owner merely because it is placed in the hands of a receiver.\\r\\nThe true position is that the receiver represents the real owner whoever he may be, and the true owner does not by the mere appointment of a receiver cease to be a landholder under the Madras Estates Land Act.\\r\\nI will now revert to the crucial question in the case, viz., whether the learned Judges of the High Court were justified in law in deciding the appeal on the footing that the judgment debtors had ceased to be the owners of Tedlain village and on that account they were not hit by clause (D).\\r\\nof the proviso to section 3 of the Madras Act.\\r\\nAt this stage, it will be useful to refer to certain provisions of the Civil Procedure Code which directly bear on the question as to when title to immovable property which is sold in execution of a decree is deemed to pass to the purchaser.\\r\\nOne of the provisions is Order XXI, rule 92, which provides that \"where no application is made under rule 89, rule 90 or rule 91, or where such application is made and disallowed, the Court shall make an order confirming the sale, and thereupon the sale shall become absolute.\\r\\n\" The second rele vant provision is section 65 which runs thus : \"Where immovable property is sold in execution of a decree and such sale has become absolute, the property shall be deemed to have vested in the purchaser from the time when the property is sold and not from the time when the sale becomes absolute.\\r\\n\" In Bhawani Kunwar vs Mathurn Prasad Singh(1) the ques tion as to when a mortgagee who has purchased certain vil lages in execution of the decree acquired title to the properties purchased by him directly arose for considera tion, and the Privy Council rightly pointed (1) T.L.R. 816 out that \"the sale in execution of the mortgage decree took effect from the actual date of the sale and not from its confirmation.\" In a simple case, the provisions cited above should settle the controversy, but, in the present case, the matter has been complicated on account of the appeal against the order refusing to set aside the sale under Order XXI, rule 90.\\r\\nIn such a case, generally speaking, the true position seems to be that there is no finality until the litigation is finally determined by the appellate Court.\\r\\nThis principle has been recognized in a number of cases, but it will be enough to cite Chandramani Shaha vs Anarjan Bibi(1).\\r\\nThe headnote of that case runs as follows : \"Where a Subordinate Judge has disallowed an applica tion under Order XXI, rule 90, to set aside a sale in execu tion, and has made an order under rule (1) confirming the sale, and an appeal from disallowance has been dismissed by the High Court, the three years \\' period provided by the Indian Limitation Act, 1908, Schedule I, article 180, for an application under Order XXI, rule 95.\\r\\nby the purchaser for delivery of possession runs from the date of the order on appeal; the High Court having under the Code of Civil Proce dure, 1908, the same powers as the Subordinate Judge, the \\'time when the sale becomes absolute \\', for the purpose of article 180 is when the High Court disposes of the appeal.\" Under article 180 of the Indian Limitation Act, the period of limitation runs \"from the date when the sale becomes absolute.\\r\\n\" If we give a narrow and literal meaning to these words, the period of limitation should be held to run from the date when the original Court of execution confirms the sale.\\r\\nBut, as was pointed out by the Privy Council, the High Court as an appellate Court had the same powers as the trial Court and it is only when the appeal was dismissed by the High Court that the order of the trial Court confirming the sale became absolute.\\r\\nTill the deci sion of the appellate Court, no finality was attached to the order confirming the sale.\\r\\n(1) I.L.R. 61 Cal.\\r\\ng45. 817 It is clear that in this case the same rule would apply to the order recording satisfaction of the decree and to the order confirming the sale.\\r\\nIf the order recording satisfac tion of the decree was not final and remained an inchoate order until the appeal was decided, the order confirming the sale would have the same inchoate character.\\r\\nThis position seems to have been fully conceded in the statement of their case filed on behalf of the respondents in this Court.\\r\\nIt is quite clear that in this case the learned Judges of the High Court have taken up an inconsistent position.\\r\\nAs I have already stated, they have held, for the purpose of allowing one of the appeals, that the judgment debtors were not hit by clause (D)of the proviso to section 3 of the Act because they ceased to be the owners of Tedlain village at the date of the sale in 1935.\\r\\nIf this conclusion is cor rect, it must follow as a matter of logic that the decree was completely satisfied on the date of the sale, because the sale fetched a larger amount than what was payable under the decree and the excess amount was deposited by the de cree holder in Court.\\r\\nThe sale and satisfaction must go together and if finality is to be attached to the sale it should have been held to attach also to the order recording satisfaction of the decree.\\r\\nIt seems clear to me that if the decree had ceased to exist, no relief could be claimed by the judgment debtors under the Madras Act.\\r\\nOn the other hand, if the appeal had to be decided on the footing that the order recording satisfaction of the decree was not final, the same approach should have been made in regard to the effect of the sale.\\r\\nIt is also clear that if the decree was satisfied on the date of sale by the application of the provisions of the Act, the sale could not stand, because how could the property be sold in execution of a decree which had been already satisfied.\\r\\nYet, notwithstanding the fact that nothing was due under the decree, the High Court has held that the sale was a good sale and was to stand.\\r\\nThe correct approach to the case would have been to assume for the purpose of the appeals that neither of the orders passed by the 818 Subordinate Judge was final.\\r\\nOn that view, the appeals to the High Court could not have been decided on the footing that the judgment debtors had ceased to be the owners of Tedlain property and were therefore not hit by clause (D) of the proviso to section 3 of the Madras Act.\\r\\nIn my opinion, the judgment of the High Court cannot be sustained, and the appeal s will have to be allowed.\\r\\nI will now deal very briefly with two preliminary objec tions raised on behalf of the respondents.\\r\\nThe first objec tion is that the application for leave to appeal to his Majesty in Council against the order of the High Court was barred by limitation, inasmuch as the reasons stated in the affidavit filed by the appellant in the High Court in sup port of his application for excusing delay do not consti tute sufficient reason within the meaning of section 5 of the Limitation Act.\\r\\nThe answer to this objection will be found in the facts which have been already narrated.\\r\\nThe delay was caused mainly by reason of the review of the order of the High Court and the High Court considered that there as sufficient reason for condoning the delay.\\r\\nThis Court cannot override the discretion exercised by the High Court and the matter cannot be reopened in these appeals.\\r\\nThe second objection is based on the fact that the decree holder was given a choice by the High Court to elect wheth er he would deposit the purchase money or have the sale set aside, and his counsel told the learned Judges on the 15th November, 1946 that his client wished to retain the property which he had purchased and pay the purchase money in cash.\\r\\nIt is contended that in view of this statement it was not open to the appellant to contend that he need not pay any amount to the judgment debtors.\\r\\nThis objection also is entirely devoid of any substance,because there is nothing on record to show that the appellant has consented to be bound by the order of the High Court and waived his right to appeal against it by reason of the election.\\r\\nThe learned counsel for the respondents also contended that the sale should have been set aside by the 819 High Court because the permission given to the decreeholder on the 16th February, 1934, to bid and set off the decretal amount against the purchase price was confined to an earlier sale and did not extend to the sate which took place on the 16th March, 1935, after the upset price which had been originally fixed was reduced.\\r\\nPersonally, I am inclined to hold that the permission covered the sale in question, but in any case it is difficult to hold on the facts stated that there was any such material irregularity as would vitiate the sale.\\r\\nThe precise argument which is put forward here was advanced in the Courts below but it did not find favour either with the Subordinate Judge or with the High Court.\\r\\nBesides, the respondents cannot raise the point in these appeals because they have filed no appeal against the order of the High Court upholding the sale.\\r\\nIn these circumstances, I would allow the appeals, set aside the orders of the High Court and restore the order of the learned Subordinate Judge.\\r\\nThere will however be no order as to costs in these appeals.\\r\\nMUKHERJEA J. I concur in the judgment just now deliv ered by ray learned brother, Fazl Ali J., and there is nothing further which I can usefully add.\\r\\nCHANDRASEKHARA AIYAR J.\\r\\nThe facts which have cha given rise to these appeals and the questions for decision have been stated in the judgment just now pronounced by my learned brother Fazl Ali J. I wish to add only a few words on the main contention advanced for the respondents by their learned Advocate, Mr. V. Rangachari.\\r\\nIf by reason of the confirmation of sale and satisfac tion of the decree having been entered up, the title to the village had passed indefeasibly to the decreeholder, there was no longer any decree or decree debt to be scaled down.\\r\\nIf, however, the title did not pass, because it was still open to the respondents to attack the Court sale under Order XXI, rule 90, they were landholders of the village and, as such, they would 820 come within the scope of proviso (D) to section 3 of the Madras Agriculturists \\' Relief Act, 1938, which enacts that a landholder who holds a village paying more than Rs. 100 as quit rent or jodi is not an agriculturist within the meaning of the Act.\\r\\nThe apparent inconsistency in the view taken by the High Court was recognised, if not conceded, by the learned coun sel.\\r\\nIn one view, there ,,as no longer any decree in respect of which the Agriculturists \\' Relief Act could operate; and in the other view, the respondents could not take advantage of the Act, as their ownership of the village precluded them.\\r\\nFaced with this dilemma, Mr. Rangachari urged a some what ingenious argument.\\r\\nHe contended that though the.\\r\\ntitle passed to the decree holder on the confirmation of sale and became vested in him from the date of the sale, the respo dents could still be regarded as having an interest in the village, as the sale was open or liable to challenge and the title \\'of the decree holder was inchoate or incomplete.\\r\\nThere is, however, really no support for this position.\\r\\nOn confir mation, the title of the decree holder became absolute or complete.\\r\\nIf the sale was set aside, the title would revest in the judgment debtor.\\r\\nThere is nothing like an equitable title in the decree holder which could be recognised for certain purposes and not recognised for others.\\r\\nUnder the Madras Act, \"agriculturist\" means \"a person who has a saleable interest in any agricultural or horticul tural land or one who holds interest in such land under a landholder as a tenant, ryot or undertenure holder.\" Section 10, sub clause (i) of the Act provides that the right conferred on an agriculturist to have a debt scaled down will not apply to any person who, though an \"agriculturist\" as defined in the Act, did not on 1 10 1937 hold an interest in or a lease or sub lease of any land.\\r\\nAfter the sale in 1935, the only interest which the judgment debtors had in the village was to have the sale set aside, under the rele vant provisions of the Civil Procedure Code.\\r\\nThis interest is not the interest contemplated by section 3, sub clause (ii) (a) & (b) of the Act which speaks of a 821 saleable interest or interest as a tenant, ryot or underten ure holder.\\r\\nI agree in the conclusion reached by my learned broth er.\\r\\nAppeals allowed.\\r\\n', {'entities': [[10, 27, 'CASE_NUMBER'], [61, 96, 'COURT'], [98, 106, 'JUDGE'], [111, 129, 'JUDGE'],

Shastri for the appellant.\\r\\nHardyal Hardy for the respondent.\\r\\nFebruary 22.\\r\\nThe Judgment of the Court was deliv ered by BOSE J.\\r\\nThis is a defendant \\'s appeal in a suit on two mortgages.\\r\\nThe first was executed on the 7th of April, 1931, by the defendant and his father.\\r\\nThe second was dated the 17th of December, 1935, and was executed by the defend ant alone.\\r\\nThe first was for a sum of Rs, 9,500, the second for Rs. 3,500.\\r\\nThe same property was mortgaged each time.\\r\\nThe claim on the two deeds together was for Rs. 20,774 3 0.\\r\\nThese mortgages were in favour of one Narayan Gopal Sathe.\\r\\nOn the 28th of March, 1940, the mortgagee assigned them both to the plaintiff who now sues on them.\\r\\nThe defence was that both mortgages were satisfied.\\r\\nThe main evidence on which the defendant relied to prove satisfaction was an agreement dated the 17th of October, 1937, executed by the mortgagee Narayan Gopal Sathe in favour of the defendant.\\r\\nThe document has been excluded from evidence by the trial Court as well as by the High Court on appeal on the ground that it required registration.\\r\\nIf this document is excluded, then there is a concurrent finding of fact by both the Courts that the rest of the evidence is not good enough to prove satisfaction.\\r\\nThey have disbelieved it and decreed the plaintiff \\'s claim in full.\\r\\nThe only ques tions before us are (1) whether this document required registration and (2) whether, if it did, it 493 cannot still be used for what the defendant claims is a collateral purpose, namely proving full payment of the mortgage amount.\\r\\nThe agreement came about in this fashion.\\r\\nThe mortga gee, Narayan Sathe, was appointed Receiver of two Cinemas in Poona.\\r\\nThe Court appointing him required him to produce a surety in the sum of Rs. 10,000.\\r\\nThe defendant agreed to undertake this responsibility and as a consideration for that the mortgagee executed the agreement in question.\\r\\nThe portions of the document relevant for the present purpose are as follows.\\r\\nThe mortgages are there described as the \"transactions of give and take.\" \"(3) It is extremely necessary to explain beforehand the transaction of give and take outstanding between both of us. (4) Whereas two transactions have been done between you and me.\\r\\nTherefore you have agreed to stand surety.\\r\\nAnd only for that reason I am executing this agreement and giving it to you in writing and thereunder I am settling and formulating some new terms and I am confirming some very terms which were declared before.\\r\\n(5) Although in the matter of the transaction relating to the aforesaid mortgage deeds the rate of interest men tioned in the documents purporting to be the mortgage deeds is 14 annas per mensem per centum, still the actual interest is to be received only at the rate of 8 annas per mensem per centum; so it is settled between you and me and I have also agreed to the same.\\r\\nAnd even at that rate I have also been receiving the interest and I shall also receive hereafter. (6) As regards the transaction of the second mortgage deed. if as agreed at that time between you and me you pay me Rs. 1,800 in the lump then it will be understood that the transaction of give and take subsisting between you and me has been wholly completed and fully paid up.\\r\\nAs you have no sufficiency of funds to make up and pay in full the above sum at once it is settled that you are to pay to me Rs. 80 per 64 494 month and thus you are to make payment in full.\\r\\nIn accord ance with the agreement arrived at between us both subse quent to the document purporting to be the second mortgage deed the said documents and papers and the written receipts in respect of interest given to you by me relating to the payment in full made by you in respect of interest and principal on account of the first transaction dated 7 4 31 have been kept with me.\\r\\n* * (8) As mentioned above (vide paras 5 and 6) no interest of any nature whatever has remained claimable by me from you in accordance with the agreement arrived at between us both from the date of your suretyship onward and prior to it and in like manner I understand that the whole of the principal has been fully paid.\\r\\n(10) If you so wish or if necessity may arise then at any time you may ask for it and I shall give you this agree ment on being written out on stamped paper and on being registered.\\r\\n\" In our opinion, this is a document which limits and extinguishes interests in immoveable property in the present within the meaning of section 17(1) (b) of the Indian Regis tration Act.\\r\\nClause (4) of the agreement expressly says so.\\r\\nReferring to the two mortgages it says \"I am settling and formulating some new terms.\\r\\n\" This speaks from the present.\\r\\nIt does not say that this was some past agreement, and that fact is underlined in the next sentence which reads \"and I am confirming some very terms which were declared before.\\r\\n\" Among the new terms is the following.\\r\\nThe rate of inter est agreed upon in the two mortgage deeds was 14 annas per cent per month.\\r\\nClause (5) reduces this to 8 annas.\\r\\nIt is true that according to clause (5) only 8 annas had actually been paid all along but that hardly 495 matters because the question is not what was paid but what was due and what the mortgagee could have enforced under his bond.\\r\\nIt is evident from clause (4) that it was the agree ment embodied in the document which effected the change and therefore it was the document itself which brought the altered terms into being.\\r\\nThe next question is whether this limits an interest in immoveable property.\\r\\nWe are of opinion it does.\\r\\nWe agree with the learned Rangoon Judges in U. Po Thin vs Official Assignee(1) that one part of the \"interest\" which a mortga gee has in mortgaged property is the right to receive inter est at a certain rate when the document provides for inter est.\\r\\nIf that rate is varied, whether to his advantage or otherwise, then, in our judgment, his \"interest\" in the property is affected.\\r\\nIf the subsequent agreement substi tutes a higher rate, then to the extent of the difference it \"creates\" a fresh \"interest\" which was not there before.\\r\\nIf the rate is lowered, then his original \"interest\" is limited.\\r\\nThe question of a higher rate was considered by their Lordships of the Privy Council in Tika Ram vs Deputy Commis sioner of Bara Banki(2).\\r\\nThere, the mortgagors gave the mortgagees an unregistered rukka or written promise simulta neously with the registered mortgage stipulating that they would pay an extra 6 per cent per annum over and above the 15 per cent entered in the mortgage.\\r\\ntheir Lordships held that these rukkas could not be used to fetter the equity of redemption.\\r\\nThey did not decide whether the personal cove nant in the rukkas could be enforced because that point had not been raised in the plaint and pleadings, nor did they refer to the Registration Act, but we think the words \"an unregistered instrument which the statute declares is not to affect the mortgaged property\" can only have reference to that Act.\\r\\n(1) (1938) R.L.R. 293: A.I.R. 1938 R. 285.\\r\\n(2) (1899) 26 I.A. 97 at 100.\\r\\n496 It was argued, on the strength of Mahim Chandra Dey vs Ram Dayal Dutta,(1) Ram Ranjan vs Jayanti lal(2) and Collec tor of Etah vs Kishori Lal(3), that it is always open to a mortgagee to release or remit a part of the debt, and when he does so he does not limit or extinguish an interest in immovable property any more than when he passes a receipt acknowledging payment of the whole or part of the money.\\r\\nThe effect of the payment, or of the release, may be to extin guish the mortgage but in themselves they do not limit the interest.\\r\\nExtending this, the learned counsel for the defendant contended that when a mortgagee agrees to accept a lower rate of interest he does no more than release that part of the debt which would be covered by the difference in rate.\\r\\nWe do not agree.\\r\\nThere is a difference between a re ceipt and a remission or a release.\\r\\nA receipt is not the payment, nor does the document in such a case serve to extinguish the mortgage or limit the liability.\\r\\nIt is the payment of the money which does that and the receipt does no more than evidence the fact.\\r\\nNot so a release.\\r\\nThe extin guishment or diminution of liability is in that event ef fected by the agreement itself and not by something external to it.\\r\\nIf the agreement is oral, it is hit by proviso 4 to section 92 of the Evidence Act, for it \"rescinds\" or \"modi fies\" the contract of mortgage.\\r\\nIf it is in writing, it is hit by section 17 (1) (b) of the Registration Act, for in that case the writing itself \"limits\" or \"extinguishes\" the liability under the mortgage.\\r\\nIt is to be observed that when the mortgagor pays money due on the mortgage, in whole or in part, he is carrying out the terms of the bond and is not making any alteration in it, and even though the fact of payment may limit or extin guish the mortgagee \\'s interest that is only because the bond is working itself out by the force of its own terms and not by reason of some new agreement which seeks to modify it or limit or extinguish the interest which it creates.\\r\\nA simple test (1)A.I.R. (3) A.I.R. 1930 All. 721 at 725 F.B. (2) A.I.R. 1926 Cal. 906.\\r\\n497 is this: see whether the mortgagee can, in the face of the subsequent agreement, enforce the terms of his bond.\\r\\nIf he cannot, then it is plain that the subsequent undertaking has effected a modification, and if that has the effect of limiting or extinguishing the mortgagee \\'s interest, it is at once hit either by section 17 (1) (b) or section 92 proviso 4.\\r\\nBut when there is a mere payment of money, that is done under the terms of the bond, for the contract of mortgage postulates that the mortgagor should repay the money bor rowed and that when he does so the mortgagee \\'s interest in the property shall be \"limited\" to the extent of the repay ment or, when all is repaid, be wholly extinguished; nor, of course, does a payment have to be made by a written or registered instrument, or even evidenced by one.\\r\\nClause (xi) to section 17 (2) of the Registration Act is based on this principle.\\r\\nIt draws a distinction between a document which, by the force of its terms.\\r\\neffects the extinguishment, or purports to do so, and one which merely evidences an exter nal fact which brings about that result.\\r\\nNow apply the test just given to the present case.\\r\\nUnder the mortgages the mortgagee is entitled to interest at 14 annas per cent.\\r\\nper month but the mortgagor says he cannot claim that.\\r\\nWhy ? Because, according to him, the subsequent agreement altered the terms of the bond and reduced his liability to only 8 annas.\\r\\nIt hardly matters what the agreement is called, whether a release or a remission, nor is it germane to the question that the mortgagee is enti tled to remit or release the whole or a part of the debt; the fact remains that his agreement to do so effects an alteration in the original contract and by the force of its terms or extinguishes his interest, Assume that the mortga gor repaid the whole of the interest at the altered rate and the whole of the principaL, would those repayments by them selves effect an extinguishment of the mortgage ? Clearly not, because unless the subsequent agreement is called in aid, more would be due under the terms of the bond on ac count of the higher rate of interest.\\r\\nIt is evident then that it is the 498 agreement which limits the mortgagee \\'s interest \\' and serves to extinguish the mortgage and not mere payment at the reduced rate.\\r\\nSimilar observations apply to clause (6) of the agree ment.\\r\\nIt begins by reciting a past agreement in which the mortgagor had promised to pay Rs. 1,800 in a lump sum.\\r\\nWe are left to infer that this was to extinguish the mortgage.\\r\\nIf it was, then it would be hit by either section 92, provi so 4, of the Evidence Act or section 17(1)(b) of the Regis tration Act, but that does not matter because the present document varies even that agreement and substitutes a third agreement in its place, namely that payment of Rs. 1,800 by instalments at the rate of Rs 80 a month will effect \"pay ment in full\", that is to say, will extinguish the mortgage.\\r\\nThis speaks from the date of the document, for it says, referring to this agreement, that \\' it is settled\" etc.\\r\\nNext we come to clause (8).\\r\\nThat refers us back to clauses (5) and (6) and says that \"as mentioned there no interest of any nature whatever has remained claimable by me\" and speaking of the principal says \"and in like manner I understand the whole of the prin cipal has been fully paid\".\\r\\nWe have already dealt with clauses (5) and (6).\\r\\nClause (8) carries us no further and merely states that because of clauses (5) and (6) neither interest nor principal is now claimable; and of course if neither interest nor principal is claimable that extinguish es the mortgage, and in this case the extinguishment is brought about, not by mere payment in accordance with the terms of the bond, but because of the fresh agreement.\\r\\nClause (10) remains for consideration.\\r\\nIt was argued that this brings the matter within section 17(2) (v) of the Registration Act because it gives the defendant the right to obtain another document which will effect the extinguish ment.\\r\\nWe do not agree because clause (v) of sub section (2) of section 17 of the Act postulates that the document shall not of itself create, declare, 499 assign, limit, extinguish any right etc., and that it shall merely create a right to obtain another document etc.\\r\\n(The stress is on the words \"itself\" and \"merely \". ) We agree with Sir Dinsha Mulla at page 86 of the 5th edition of his Indian Registration Act that \"If the document itself creates an interest in immove able property, the fact that it contemplates the execution of another document will not exempt it from registration under this clause.\\r\\n\" As we have seen, this document of itself limits or extinguishes certain interests in the mortgaged property),.\\r\\nThe operative words are reasonably clear.\\r\\nConsequently, the document is not one which merely confers a right to obtain another document.\\r\\nIt confers the right only in certain contingencies, namely, \"if you so wish\" or \"if necessity may arise.\\r\\n\" Its purport is to effect an immediate alteration in the terms of the two bonds and because of that alteration to effect an immediate extinguishment and limitation.\\r\\nClause (10) merely confers an additional right, namely the right to obtain another document \"if you so wish\" or \"if necessity may arise.\" Therefore, the document in question is not one which merely creates a right to obtain another.\\r\\nAn agreement to sell, or an agreement to transfer at some future date, is to be distinguished because that sort of document does not of itself purport to effect the trans fer.\\r\\nIt merely embodies a present agreement to execute another document in the future which will, when executed, have that effect.\\r\\nThe document in hand is not of that type.\\r\\nIt does not postpone the effect of extinguishment or limita tion of the mortgages to a future date.\\r\\nIt does not say that the agreement it embodies shall take effect in the future.\\r\\nIt purports to limit and extinguish the liabilities on the two mortgages at once by virtue of the document itself and merely adds that \"if it is necessary or should you want another document, I will repeat the present 500 agreement in a registered agreement.\\r\\n\" By implication it means that if it is not necessary, or if the mortgagor does not want a registered instrument, the document itself will have effect.\\r\\nIncidentally, one effect of holding that this document does not limit or extinguish the mortgagor \\'s li ability would be that there is no agreement to that effect yet in force, This may or may not give the mortgagor a right to obtain specific performance of his right to obtain such an agreement but until he does that there would be no bar to the mortgagee \\'s claim in this suit.\\r\\nHowever, it is not necessary to go as far as that because we are of opinion that this document is not exempt from registration under section 17(2) (v), and we so hold.\\r\\nThe next question is whether the document can be used in evidence under the proviso to section 49 of the Registration Act.\\r\\nWe are clear it cannot.\\r\\nThis is not a suit for specif ic performance nor does any question of part performance under section 53A of the Transfer of Property Act arise.\\r\\nIt remains then to be seen whether the use now sought to be made of the document is to evidence a collateral transaction not required to be evidenced by a registered instrument.\\r\\nBut what is the \\'transaction sought to be proved but the very agreement which the document not merely evidences but, by reason of its own force, creates ? That is not a collat eral transaction and even if it were a transaction of that type, it would require a registered instrument for the reasons we have already given.\\r\\nSection 53A of the Transfer of Property Act was re ferred to but it has no application, for the agreement we are concerned with is not a transfer.\\r\\nThere are no words of conveyance in it; also the mortgagor is not continuing in possession in part performance of the contract.\\r\\nBoth mort gages were simple and the right to possession never resided in the mortgagee.\\r\\nHe might in due course have acquired it by process of law if he obtained a decree and purchased at the sale; on the other hand, a stranger might have purchased and the right to possession would \\'in that event have passed elsewhere, But he had no right to possession at the 501 date of the agreement and having none he could not have transferred it.\\r\\nThe mortgagor \\'s possession was consequently not referable to the agreement.\\r\\nThe appeal fails and is dismissed with costs.\\r\\nAppeal dismissed.\\r\\n', {'entities': [[0, 29, 'CASE_NUMBER'], [71, 92, 'DATE'], [101, 125, 'COURT'], [129, 135, 'GPE'], [137, 157, 'JUDGE'], [162, 183, 'CASE_NUMBER'], [212, 231, 'DATE'], [240, 282, 'COURT'], [286, 291, 'GPE'], [295, 322, 'CASE_NUMBER'], [324, 351, 'LAWYER'], [372, 385, 'LAWYER'], [407, 419, 'DATE'], [465, 472, 'JUDGE'], [563, 581, 'DATE'], [642, 664, 'DATE'], [740, 745, 'OTHERS'], [766, 772, 'OTHERS'], [866, 877, 'OTHERS'], [946, 965, 'DATE'], [1190, 1211, 'DATE'], [1785, 1788, 'OTHERS'], [2033, 2039, 'GPE'], [2117, 2124, 'OTHERS'], [3444, 3453, 'OTHERS'], [3732, 3738, 'OTHERS'], [3743, 3749, 'OTHERS'], [4825, 4842, 'PROVISION'], [4850, 4875, 'STATUTE'], [5358, 5368, 'PROVISION'], [5424, 5434, 'PROVISION'], [5497, 5500, 'OTHERS'], [5647, 5657, 'PROVISION'], [5975, 6006, 'PRECEDENT'], [6618, 6666, 'PRECEDENT'], [7188, 7204, 'STATUTE'], [7386, 7405, 'PRECEDENT'], [7476, 7512, 'PRECEDENT'], [7517, 7545, 'PRECEDENT'], [7550, 7586, 'PRECEDENT'], [7841, 7847, 'OTHERS'], [8734, 8744, 'PROVISION'], [8752, 8764, 'STATUTE'], [8860, 8878, 'PROVISION'], [8886, 8903, 'STATUTE'], [9487, 9497, 'PRECEDENT'], [9498, 9509, 'PRECEDENT'], [9535, 9561, 'PRECEDENT'], [9878, 9896, 'PROVISION'], [9900, 9921, 'PROVISION'], [10394, 10408, 'PROVISION'], [10416, 10432, 'STATUTE'], [11900, 11910, 'PROVISION'], [12017, 12022, 'OTHERS'], [12145, 12155, 'PROVISION'], [12176, 12188, 'STATUTE'], [12192, 12208, 'PROVISION'], [12216, 12233, 'STATUTE'], [12391, 12396, 'OTHERS'], [12649, 12658, 'PROVISION'], [12685, 12704, 'PROVISION'], [12950, 12968, 'PROVISION'], [12972, 12982, 'PROVISION'], [13039, 13058, 'PROVISION'], [13355, 13365, 'PROVISION'], [13444, 13461, 'PROVISION'], [13469, 13485, 'STATUTE'], [13618, 13628, 'PROVISION'], [13632, 13661, 'PROVISION'], [13739, 13742, 'OTHERS'], [13926, 13942, 'OTHERS'], [13980, 14003, 'STATUTE'], [14725, 14736, 'PROVISION'], [16416, 16433, 'PROVISION'], [16539, 16549, 'PROVISION'], [16557, 16574, 'STATUTE'], [16694, 16705, 'PROVISION'], [16725, 16737, 'STATUTE'], [17247, 17258, 'PROVISION'], [17266, 17290, 'STATUTE'], [17886, 17889, 'OTHERS']]}]\n",

Banerjee (B. Banerjee, with him), for the appel lant.\\r\\n768 S.P. Sinha (N.C. Sen, with him), for the respondents.\\r\\nNovember 14.\\r\\nThe court delivered judgment as follows : MUKHERJEA J.\\r\\nThis appeal is directed against an appel late judgment of a Division Bench of the Allahabad High Court dated September 6, 1943, by which the learned Judges reversed a decision of the Civil Judge, Etawah, made in Original Suit No. 28 of 1936.\\r\\nThe suit was one commenced by the plaintiff, who is respondent No. 1 in this appeal, for recovery of possession of two items of immovable property one, a residential house and other, a shop both of which are situated in the town of Etawah.\\r\\nThe properties admittedly formed part of the estate of one Mangal Sen who died sometime towards the end of the last century, leaving behind him, as his heirs, his two widows, Mst.\\r\\nMithani and Mst.\\r\\nMangal Sen had a son named Chhedi Lal and a daughter named Janki Kuar born of his wife Mst.\\r\\nRani, but both of them died during his lifetime.\\r\\nChhedi Lal had no issue and he was survived by his widow Mst.\\r\\nMeria,while Janki left a son named Thakur Prasad.\\r\\nJanki \\'s husband married another wife and by her got a son named Babu Ram.\\r\\nOn Mangal Sen \\'s death, his properties devolved upon his two widows, and Mst.\\r\\nRani having died subsequently, Mst.\\r\\nMithani came to hold the entire estate of her husband in the restricted rights of a Hindu widow.\\r\\nOn 27th November 1919, Mst.\\r\\nMithani surrendered the whole estate of her husband by a deed of gift in favour of Thakur Prasad who was the nearest reversioner at that time.\\r\\nThakur Prasad died in 1921, leaving a minor son named Nand Lal who succeeded to his properties and this Nand Lal is the plain tiff in the suit out of which this appeal arises.\\r\\nOn 27th October 1921, there was a transaction entered into between Babu Ram on his own behalf as well as guardian of infant Nand Lal on the One hand and Mst.\\r\\nMeria, the widow of Chhedi Lal, on 769 the other, by which two items of property which are the subject matter of the present litigation were conveyed to Meria by a deed of transfer which has been described as a Tamliknama; and she on her part executed a deed of relin quishment renouncing her claims to every portion of the estate left by Mangal Sen.\\r\\nIt is not disputed that Meria took possession of the properties on the basis of the Tam liknama and on 10th April 1923 she executed a will, by which these properties were bequeathed to her three nephews, who are the sons of her brother Sunder Lal.\\r\\nMeria died on 19th June 1924.\\r\\nOne Ram Dayal had obtained a money decree against Sunder Lal and his three sons, and in execution of that decree the properties in suit were attached and put up to sale and they were purchased by Ram Dayal himself on 30th January 1934.\\r\\nOn 1st June 1936, the present suit was insti tuted by Nand Lal and he prayed for recovery of possession of these two items of property on the allegation that as they were given to Mst.\\r\\nMeria for her maintenance and resi dence, she could enjoy the same only so long as she lived and after her death, they reverted to the plaintiff.\\r\\nSunder Lal, the brother of Meria, was made the first defendant in the suit, and his three sons figured as defendants Nos.\\r\\n2 to 4.\\r\\nDefendant No. 5 is a lady named Chimman Kunwar in whose favour Sunder Lal was alleged to have executed a deed of transfer in respect of a portion of the disputed proper ty.\\r\\nRam Dayal, the decree holder auction purchaser, died in May 1935 and his properties vested in his daughter \\'s son Ram Gopal under a deed of gift executed by him in favour of the latter.\\r\\nOn 1st September 1938, Ram Gopal was added as a party defendant to the suit on the plaintiff \\'s application and he is defendant No. 6.\\r\\nThe two other defendants, namely, defendants 7 and 8, who were also made parties at the same time, are respectively the widow and an alleged adopted son of Ram Dayal.\\r\\nThe suit was contested primarily by defendant No. 6, and the substantial contentions raised by him in his written statement were of a two fold character.\\r\\n770 The first and the main contention was that Mst.\\r\\nMeria got an absolute title to the disputed properties on the strength of the \\'Tamliknama \\' executed in her favour by the guardian of the plaintiff and after her death, the properties passed on to the three sons of Sunder Lal who were the legatees under her will.\\r\\nRam Dayal, it was said, having purchased these properties execution of a money decree against Sunder Lal and his three sons acquired a valid title to them.\\r\\nThe other contention raised was that the suit was barred by limitation.\\r\\nThe trial Judge decided both these points in favour of the contesting defendant and dismissed the plain tiff \\'s suit.\\r\\nOn appeal to the High Court, the judgment of the Civil Judge was set aside and the plaintiff \\'s suit was decreed.\\r\\nThe defendant No. 6 has now come up on appeal to this court and Mr. Peary Lal Banerjee, who appeared in support of the appeal, pressed before us both the points upon which the decision of the High Court has been adverse to his client.\\r\\nThe first point raised by Mr. Banerjee turns upon the construction to be placed upon the document executed by Babu Ram on his own behalf as well as on behalf of Nand Lal then an infant, by which the properties in dispute were trans ferred to Mst.\\r\\nMeria by way of a \\'Tamliknama \\'.\\r\\nThe question is whether the transferee got, under it, an absolute inter est in the properties, which was heritable and alien able or was it the interest of a life tenant merely.\\r\\nThe documentis by no means a complicated one.\\r\\nIt begins by a recital of the events under which Nand Lal became the sole owner of the properties left by Mangal Sen and refers in this connection to the obligation on the part of both Babu Ram and Nand Lal to \"support, maintain and console\" Mst.\\r\\nMeria, the widow of the pre deceased son of Mangal Sen.\\r\\nThe document then proceeds to state as follows: \"I have therefore, of my own accord and free will without any compulsion or coercion on the part of any one else while in my proper senses made a Tamlik of a double storied pucca built shop . and a house 771 and a kothri in Etawah . . worth Rs. 8,000 for purposes of residence of the Musammat, owned by the minor aforesaid . which at present stands let out on rent to Sunder Lal, brother of Mst.\\r\\nMeria aforesaid . . in favour of Mst.\\r\\nMeria aforesaid, widow of Chhedi Lal and made her the owner (Malik).\\r\\nIf any portion or the whole of the property made a Tamlik of for the purpose mentioned above passes out of the possession of the Musammat aforesaid on account of the claim of Nand Lal minor aforesaid, I and my property of every sort shall be responsible and liable for the same.\\r\\n\" This document has got to be read along with the deed of relinquishment, which is a contemporaneous document execut ed by Meria renouncing all her claims to the property left by Mangal Sen.\\r\\nThe deed of relinquishment like the Tamliknama recites elaborately, with reference to previous events, particularly to the deed of gift executed by Mst.\\r\\nMithani in favour of Thakur Prasad, the gradual devolution of the entire estate of Mangal Sen upon Nand Lal.\\r\\nIt states thereafter that Babu Ram, as the guardian of the minor and also in his own right, \"has under a Tamliknama dated this day made a \\'Tamlik \\'.\\r\\nin my favour of a shop alongwith a Balakhana and a kota for my maintenance and a house . . for purpose of my residence which are quite sufficient for my maintenance.\" \"I have therefore, of my own accord \", the document goes on to say, \"made a relinquishment of the entire property aforesaid mentioned in the deed of gift . worth Rs. 25,000.\\r\\nI do covenant and do give in writing that I have and shall have no claim to or concern with the property . . belonging to the minor afore said, nor has the property aforesaid remained subject to my maintenance allowance nor shall I bring any claim at any time.\\r\\n\" The schedule to the instrument, it may be noted, gives a list of all the properties of Mangal Sen in respect to which Mst.\\r\\nMithani executed a deed of gift in favour of Thakur Prasad, including the two items of property covered by the \\'Tamliknama \\' mentioned aforesaid.\\r\\n772 In construing a document whether in English or in vernacular the fundamental rule is to ascertain the inten tion from the words used; the surrounding circumstances are to be considered, but that is only for the purpose of finding out the intended meaning of the words which have actually been employed(1).\\r\\nIn the present case the instru ment of grant has been described as a \\'Tamliknama \\' which means a document by which \\' Maliki \\' or ownership rights are transferred and the document expressly says that the grantee has been made a \\' Malik \\' or owner.\\r\\nThere are no express words making the gift heritable and transferable; nor on the other hand, is there any statement that the transferee would enjoy the properties only during her life time and that they would revert to the grantor after her death.\\r\\nIt may be taken to be quite settled that there is no warrant for the proposition of law that when a grant of an immovable property is made to a Hindu female, she does not get an absolute or alienable interest in such property, unless such power is expressly conferred upon her.\\r\\nThe reasoning adopted by Mr. Justice Mitter of the Calcutta High Court in Kollani Koer vs Luchmee Parsad(2) which was ap proved of and accepted by the Judicial Committee in a number of decisions, seems to me to be unassailable.\\r\\nIt was held by the Privy Council as early as in the case of Tagore vs Tagore( \\'3) that if an estate were given to a man without express words of inheritance, it would, in the absence of a conflicting context, carry, by Hindu Law, an estate of inheritance.\\r\\nThis is the general principle of law which is recognised and embodied in section 8 of the Transfer of Property Act and unless it is shown that under Hindu Law a gift to a female means a limited gift or carries with it the restrictions or disabilities similar to those that exist in a \\'widow \\'s estate \\', there is no justification for departing from this principle.\\r\\nThere is certainly no such provision in Hindu Law and no text could be supplied in support of the same.\\r\\n(1) Vide Rajgndra Prasad vs Gopal Prasad.\\r\\n57 I.A. 296.\\r\\n(2) (3) L.R.I.A. Supp.\\r\\n47 at 65.\\r\\n773 The position, therefore, is that to convey an absolute estate to a Hindu female, no express power of alienation need be given; it is enough if words are used of such ampli tude as would convey full rights of ownership.\\r\\nMr. Banerjee naturally lays stress upon the description of the document as \\'Tamliknama \\' and the use of the word \\' Malik \\' or owner in reference to the interest which it pur ports to convey to the transferee.\\r\\nThe word \\' Malik \\' is of very common use in many parts of India and it cannot cer tainly be regarded as a technical term of conveyancing.\\r\\nIn the language of the Privy Council, the term \\'Malik \\' when used in a will or other document \"as descriptive of the position which a devisee or donee is intended to hold, has been held apt to describe an owner possessed of full pro prietory rights, including a full right of alienation, unless there is something in the context or in the surround ing circumstances to indicate that such full proprietory rights were not intended to be conferred(1). \\' \\' This I think to be a perfectly correct statement of law and I only desire to add that it should be taken with the caution which the Judicial Committee uttered in course of the same observa tion that \"the meaning of every word in an Indian document must always depend upon the setting in which it is placed, the subject to which it is related and the locality of the grantor from which it receives its true shade of meaning.\\r\\n\" The question before us, therefore, narrows down to this as to whether in the present case there is anything in the context of these two connected instruments or in the sur rounding circumstances to cut down the full proprietory rights that the word \\'Malik \\' ordinarily imports.\\r\\nThe High Court in reaching its decision adverse to the appellant laid great stress on the fact that the grant was expressed to be for maintenance and residence of Mst.\\r\\nMeria.\\r\\nThis, it is said, would prima facie indicate that the grant was to enure for the lifetime of the grantee.\\r\\nIt is pointed out by the learned (1) Vide Sasiman Chowdhurain vs Shib Narayan, 49 I.A, 25.\\r\\n99 774 Judges that the language of the document does not show that anybody else besides the lady herself was to be benefited by the grant and the indemnity given by Babu Ram was also given to the lady personally.\\r\\nIt is further said that if Meria was given an absolute estate in the properties comprised in the \\'Tamliknama \\', there was no necessity for including these two properties again in the deed of relinquishment which she executed at the same time.\\r\\nI do not think that the mere fact that the gift of property is made for the support and maintenance of a female relation could be taken to be a prima facie indication of the intention of the donor, that the donee was to enjoy the property only during her life time.\\r\\nThe extent of interest, which the donee is to take, depends upon the intention of the donor as expressed by the language use, d, and if the dispositive words employed in the document are clear and unambiguous and import absolute ownership, the purpose of the grant would not, by itself, restrict or cut down the interest.\\r\\nThe desire to provide maintenance or residence of the donee would only show the motive which prompted the donor to make the gift, but it could not be read as a meas ure of the extent of the gift.\\r\\nThis was laid down in clear terms by the Judicial Committee in a comparatively recent case which is to be found reported in Bishunath Prasad vs Chandrika(1).\\r\\nThere a Hindu executed a registered deed of gift of certain properties in favour of his daughter in law for the\" support and maintenance\" of his daughter in law and declared that the donee should remain absolute owner of the property (malik mustaqil) and pay Government revenue.\\r\\nThere were no words in the document expressly making the interest heritable or conferring on the donee the power of making alienation.\\r\\nIt was held by the Judicial Committee that the donee took under the document, an absolute estate with powers to make alienation giving title valid after her death.\\r\\nIn course of the judgment, Lord Blanesburgh quoted, with approval, an earlier decision of the (1) 60 I.A 56 775 Judicial Committee, where the words \"for your maintenance\" occurring in a deed of gift were held insufficient to cut down to life interest the estate taken by the donees.\\r\\nThese words, it was said, \"are quite capable of signifying that the gift was made for the purpose of enabling them to live in comfort and do not necessarily mean that it was to be limited to a bare right of maintenance.\\r\\n\" On behalf of the respondent, reliance was placed upon the decision of the Judicial Committee in Raja Ram Buksh vs Arjun(1)in support of the contention that in a maintenance grant it is the prima facie intention of the gift that it should be for life.\\r\\nIn my opinion, the decision cited is no authority for the general proposition as is contended for by the learned Counsel for the respondent, and it is to be read in the context of the actual facts of the case which relate to grants of a particular type with special features of its own.\\r\\nIt was a case where a Talukdar made a grant of certain villages to a junior member of the joint family for mainte nance of the latter.\\r\\nThe family was governed by the law of primegeniture and the estate descended to a single heir.\\r\\nIn such cases the usual custom is that the junior members of the family, who can get no share in the property, are enti tled to provisions by way of maintenance for which assign ments of lands are generally made in their favour.\\r\\nThe extent of interest taken by the grantee in the assigned lands depends entirely upon the circumstances of the partic ular case, or rather upon the usage that prevails in the particular family.\\r\\nIn the case before the Privy Council there was actually no deed of transfer.\\r\\nIt was an oral assignment made by the Talukdar, and the nature of the grant had to be determined upon the recitals of a petition for mutation of names made to the Revenue Department by the grantor after the verbal assignment was made and from other facts and circumstances of the case.\\r\\nThe case of Woodoya ditta Deb vs Mukoond(2), which was referred to and relied upon in the judgment of the Privy Council, was (1) 28 I.A, 1.\\r\\n(2) 22 w.\\r\\nR. 229.\\r\\n776 also a case of maintenance or khor phos grant made in favour of a junior member of the family, where theestate was im partible and descended under the rules of primogeniture.\\r\\nIt was held in that case that such grants, the object of which was to make suitable provisions for the immediate members of the family, were by their very nature and also under the custom of the land resumable by the zemindar on the death of the grantee, as otherwise the whole zemindary would be swallowed up by continual demands.\\r\\nThis principle bas obviously no application to cases of the type which we have before us and it was never so applied by the Privy Council, as would appear from the decision referred to above.\\r\\nThe learned Counsel for the plaintiff respondent drew our attention in this connection, to the fact that the properties given by the ,Tamliknama \\' were valued at Rs. 8,000, whereas the entire estate left by Mangal Sen was worth Rs. 25,000 only.\\r\\nIt is argued that the transfer of nearly one third of the entire estate in absolute right to one who was entitled to maintenance merely, is, on the face of it, against probability and common sense.\\r\\nI do not think that, on the facts of this case, any weight could be at tached to this argument.\\r\\nIn the first place, it is to be noted that whatever might have been the actual market value of the properties, what the widow got under the Tamliknama was a residential house and a shop, and the shop was the only property which fetched any income.\\r\\nThis shop, it appears, was all along in possession of Sunder Lal, the brother of Meria, and the rent, which he paid or promised to pay in respect of the same, was only Rs. 12 a month.\\r\\nSo from the income of this property it was hardly possible for Meria to have even abate maintenance, and this would rather support the inference that the properties were given to her absolutely and not for enjoyment merely, so long as she lived.\\r\\nBut what is more important is, that the object of creating these two documents, as the surrounding circumstances show, was not merely to make provision 777 for the maintenance of Mst.\\r\\nMeria; the other and the more important object was to perfect the title of Nand Lal to the estate left by Mangal Sen and to quiet all disputes that freight arise in respect of the same.\\r\\nIt may be that Mst.\\r\\nMeria could not, in law, claim any.\\r\\nthing more than a right to be maintained out of the estate of her deceased father in law.\\r\\nBut it is clear that whatever her legal rights might have been, Nand Lal \\'s own position as the sole owner of the properties left by Mangal Sen was not altogeth er undisputed or free from any hostile attack.\\r\\nAs has been said already, Sunder Lal, the brother of Meria, was in occupation of the double storied shop from long before the Tamliknama was executed and Meria got any legal title to it.\\r\\nIt appears from the record that in 1920 a suit was institut ed on behalf of the infant Nand Lal for evicting Sunder Lal from the shop and the allegation in the plaint was that Sunder Lal was occupying the property as a tenant since the time of Mst.\\r\\nMithani by taking a settlement from her.\\r\\nSunder Lal in his written statement filed in that suit expressly repudiated the allegation of tenancy and also the title of Nand Lal and openly asserted that it was Mst.\\r\\nMeria who was the actual owner of Mangal Sen \\'s estate.\\r\\nThe suit ended in a compromise arrived at through the medium of arbitrators and the result was that although Sunder Lal admitted the title of the plaintiff, the latter had to abandon the claims which were made in the plaint for rents, costs and damages.\\r\\nSunder Lal continued to be in occupation of the shop and executed a rent agreement in respect of the same in favour of Nand Lal promising to pay a rent of Rs. 12 per month.\\r\\nA few months later, the Tamliknama was executed and this shop along with the residential house were given to Meria in maliki right.\\r\\nThe recitals in both the Tamliknama and the deed of relin quishment clearly indicate that the supreme anxiety on the part of Babu Ram, who was trying his best to safeguard the interests of the minor, was to put an end to all further disputes that might be raised by or on behalf of Mst.\\r\\nMeria with regard to the rights of Nand Lal to the properties 778 of Mangal Sen and to make his title to the same absolutely impeccable.\\r\\nThat seems to be the reason why Meria was given a comparatively large portion of the properties left by Mangal Sen which would enable her to live in comfort and her interest was not limited to a bare right of mainte nance.\\r\\nIt is significant to note that the shop room, which was all along in possession of Sunder Lal, was included in this Tamliknama and soon after the grant was made, Sunder Lal executed a rent agreement in respect of the shop in favour of Mst.\\r\\nMeria acknowledging her to be the owner of the property.\\r\\nIt is true that the document does not make any reference to the heirs of Meria, but that is not at all necessary, nor is it essential that any express power of alienation should be given.\\r\\nThe word \"Malik\" is too common an expres sion in this part of the country and its meaning and impli cations were fairly well settled by judicial pronouncements long before the document was executed.\\r\\nIf really the grantee was intended to have only a life interest in the properties, there was no lack of appropriate words, per fectly well known in the locality, to express such inten tion.\\r\\nThe High Court seems to have been influenced to some extent by the fact that in the Tamliknama there was a guarantee given by Babu Ram to Meria herself and to no one else agreeing to compensate her in case she was dispossessed from the properties at the instance of Nand Lal.\\r\\nThis covenant in the document was in the nature of a personal guarantee given by Babu Ram to Mst.\\r\\nMeria for the simple reason that the property belonged to an infant and it was as guardian of the minor that Babu Ram was purporting to act.\\r\\nIt was too much to expect that Babu Ram would bind himself for all time to come and give a guarantee to the future heirs of Meria as well.\\r\\nProbably no such thing was contem plated by the parties and no such undertaking was insisted upon by the other side.\\r\\nBut whatever the reason might be which led to the covenant being expressed in this particu lar form, I do not think that it has even a remote bearing on the 779 question that arises for our consideration in the present case.\\r\\nIt is of no assistance to the plaintiff in support of the construction that is sought to be put upon the , docu ment on his behalf.\\r\\nI am also not at all impressed by the other fact re ferred to in the judgment of the High Court that if the properties were given to Meria in absolute right, there was no necessity for including them again in the schedule to the deed of relinquishment which Meria executed.\\r\\nI fail to see how the inclusion of the properties in the deed of relin quishment would go to indicate that Meria \\'s rights to these properties were of a restricted and not an absolute charac ter.\\r\\nIt is after all a pure matter of conveyancing and the two documents have to be read together as parts of one and the same \\' transaction.\\r\\nUnder the \\' Tamliknama \\', Meria got two properties in absolute right out of the estate of Mangal Sen.\\r\\nBy the deed of relinquishment, she renounced her claim for maintenance in respect of all the properties left by Mangal Sen including the two items which she got under the \\'Tamliknama \\'.\\r\\nAfter the \\' Tamliknama \\' was executed in her favour, there Was no further question of her claiming any right of maintenance in respect of these two items of property.\\r\\nShe became the absolute owner thereof in exchange of her rights of maintenance over the entire estate and this right of maintenance she gave up by the deed of relinquish ment.\\r\\nOn a construction of the entire document, my conclu sion is that there is nothing in the context of the docu ment, or in the surrounding circumstances which would dis place the presumption of full proprietory rights which the use of the word \"Malik\" is apt ordinarily to convey.\\r\\nThe first contention of the appellant, therefore, succeeds and in view of my decision on this point, the second question does not arise for determination at all.\\r\\nThe result is that the appeal is allowed, the judgment and decree of the High Court are set aside and those of the trial Judge restored.\\r\\nThe defendant No. 6 will have his costs from the plaintiff in all the courts.\\r\\nThere will be no order for costs as regards the other parties: 780 FAZL ALI J.\\r\\nI agree with the judgment delivered by my learned brother, Mukherjea J. CHANDRASEKHARA AIYAR J.\\r\\nDuring the hearing of the appeal I entertained doubts whether the view taken by the High Court was not correct.\\r\\nBut on further consideration, I find that it cannot be maintained, having regard to the terms of the \\' Tamliknama \\' (deed of transfer) in favour of Musammat Meria and the context in which it came into exist ence.\\r\\nThe name of the document or deed does not very much matter.\\r\\nThough the word \\' malik \\' is not a term of art, it has been held in quite a large number of cases, decided mostly by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, that the word, as employed in Indian documents, means absolute owner and that unless the context indicated a different meaning, its use would be sufficient to convey a full title even without the addition of the words, \\' heirs \\', or \\' son \\', \\' grandson \\' and \\' great grandson \\'.\\r\\nOf course, if there are other clauses in the document which control the import of the word and restrict the estate to a limited one, we must give the narrower meaning; otherwise the word must receive its full significance.\\r\\nEspecially is this so, when the rule of interpretation laid down in Mohammed Shamsul vs Sewak Ram( \\') has come to be regarded as unsound.\\r\\nThe language employed in the \\' Tamliknama \\' (exhibit II) is almost similar to the language of the deeds construed in Bhaidas Shivdas vs Bai Gulab & Another( \\'2) and Bishunath Prasad Singh vs Chandika Prasad Kumari and Others(s) where it was held that an absolute estate was conveyed.\\r\\nI agree that the judgment and decree of the High Court should be set aside and that the decree of the trial Judge should be restored with costs to the appellant in all the Courts.\\r\\nAppeal allowed.\\r\\n', {'entities': [[4, 16, 'CASE_NUMBER'], [50, 70, 'COURT'], [72, 77, 'JUDGE'], [82, 87, 'JUDGE'], [99, 118, 'DATE'], [135, 149, 'CASE_NUMBER'], [151, 164, 'LAWYER'], [166, 177, 'LAWYER'], [215, 225, 'LAWYER'], [227, 235, 'LAWYER'], [270, 282, 'DATE'], [326, 338, 'JUDGE'], [449, 466, 'DATE'], [561, 581, 'CASE_NUMBER'], [1573, 1591, 'DATE'], [1923, 1940, 'DATE'], [2694, 2709, 'DATE'], [2928, 2946, 'DATE'], [2951, 2964, 'DATE'], [3643, 3651, 'DATE'], [3777, 3795, 'DATE'], [7833, 7844, 'OTHERS'], [9917, 9926, 'STATUTE'], [10028, 10037, 'PROVISION'], [10045, 10069, 'STATUTE'], [10430, 10481, 'PRECEDENT'], [10491, 10516, 'PRECEDENT'], [16808, 16822, 'OTHERS'], [16828, 16842, 'OTHERS'], [17712, 17721, 'OTHERS'], [17778, 17788, 'OTHERS'], [18509, 18515, 'OTHERS'], [20621, 20627, 'OTHERS'], [25409, 25420, 'JUDGE'], [25481, 25490, 'JUDGE'], [25494, 25514, 'JUDGE']]}]\n",

Misra, with him) for the appel lants.\\r\\nRang Behari Lal (N.C. Sen, with him) for the respond ents.\\r\\nMarch 7.\\r\\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by MUKHERJEA J.\\r\\nThis appeal is on behalf of the judgment debtor in a proceeding for execution of a money decree and it is directed against the judgment of a Letters Patent Bench of the Punjab High Court dated 18th of May, 1949.\\r\\nby which the learned Judges 546 affirmed, in appeal, a decision of a single Judge of that court dated 29th October, 1946.\\r\\nThe original order against which the appeal was taken to the High Court was made by the Senior Subordinate Judge, Ambala, in Execution Case No. 18 of 1945 dismissing the objections preferred by the appel lants under section 47 of the Civil Procedure Code.\\r\\nTo appreciate the contentions that have been raised in this appeal, it would be necessary to give a short narrative of the material events in their chronological order.\\r\\nOn September 30, 1925, Baldev Das, the father of the appel lants, who was, at that time the manager of a joint Hindu family, consisting of himself and his sons, executed a mortgage bond in favour of Mst.\\r\\nNaraini, the original re spondent No. 1, and another person named Talok Chand, by which certain movable properties belonging to the joint family were hypothecated to secure a loan of Rs 16,000.\\r\\nOn April 16, 1928, the appellants along with a minor brother of theirs named Sumer Chand filed a suit: being Suit No. 23 of 1928 in the Court of the Subordinate Judge of Shahjahanpur against their father Baldev Das for partition of the joint family properties.\\r\\nThe suit culminated in a final decree for partition on 20th July, 1928, and the joint family properties were divided by metes and bounds and separate possession was taken by the father and the sons.\\r\\nOn 29th September, 1934, Mst.\\r\\nNaraini filed a suit in the Court of the Senior Subordinate Judge, Ambala, against Baldev Das for recovery of a sum of Rs. 12;500 only on the basis of the mortgage bond referred to above.\\r\\nIt was stated in the plaint that the money was borrowed by the defendant as manager of a joint Hindu family and the plaintiff prayed for a decree against the mortgaged property as well as against the joint family.\\r\\nOn 18th December, 1934, the appellants made an application before the Subordinate Judge under Order I, Rule 10, and Order XXXIV, Rule 1, Civil Procedure Code, praying that they might be added as parties defendants to the suit and the points in issue arising therein might be decided in their presence.\\r\\nIt was asserted in the 547 petition that Baldev Das was not the manager of a joint family and that the family properties had been partitioned by a decree of the court, as a result of which the proper ties alleged to be the subject matter of the mortgage were allotted to the share of the petitioners.\\r\\nIn reply to this petition, the plaintiff \\'s counsel stated in court on 7th February, 1935, that his client would give up the claim for a mortgage decree against the properties in suit and would be satisfied only with a money decree against Baldev Das personally.\\r\\nThe plaint was amended accordingly, deleting all reference to the joint family and abandoning the claim against the mortgaged property.\\r\\nUpon this the appellants withdrew their application for being made parties to the suit and reserved their right to take proper legal action if and when necessary.\\r\\nOn April 17, 1935, Baldev Das died and on 2nd September following the appellants as well as their mother, who figures as respondent No. 5 in this appeal, were brought on the record as legal representatives of Baldev Das.\\r\\nOn October 9, 1935, the appellants filed a written statement in which a number of pleas were taken in answer to the plaintiff \\'s claim and it was asserted in paragraph 10 of the written statement that Baldev Das dealt Badri or specu lative transactions, and if any money was due to the plain tiff at all in connection with such transactions the debt was illegal and immoral and not binding on the family property.\\r\\nOn the same day the court recorded an order to the effect that as the plaintiff had given up her claim for a mortgage decree, the legal representatives of the deceased could not be allowed to raise pleas relating to the validity or otherwise of the mortgage.\\r\\nOn 20th November, 1935, the parties arrived at a compromise and on the basis of the same, a simple money decree was passed in favour of the plaintiff for the full amount claimed in the suit together with half costs amounting to Rs. 425 annas odd against the estates of Baldev Das in the hands of his legal representa tives.\\r\\nAfter certain attempts at execution of this decree which did not prove successful, 548 the present application for execution was flied by the decree holder on March 13, 1945, in the court of the Senior Subordinate Judge, Ambala, and in accordance with the prayer contained therein, the court directed the attachment of certain immovable properties consisting of a number of shops in possession of the appellants and situated at a place called Abdullaput.\\r\\nOn April 23, 1945, the appellants filed objections under section 47, Civil Procedure Code, and they opposed the attachment of the properties substantially on the ground that those properties did not belong to Baldev Das but were the separate and exclusive properties of the objectors which they obtained on partition with their father long before the decree was passed.\\r\\nIt was asserted that these properties could not be made liable for the satisfac tion of the decretal dues which had to be realised under the terms of the decree itself from the estate left by Baldev Das.\\r\\nAfter hearing the parties and the evidence adduced by them the Subordinate Judge came to the conclusion that there was in fact a partition between Baldev Das and his sons in the year 1928 and as a result of the same, the properties, which were attached at the instance of the decree holder, were allotted to the share of the sons.\\r\\nThe decree sought to be executed was obtained after the partition, but it was in respect of a debt which was contracted by the father prior to it.\\r\\nIt was held in these circumstances that the separate share of the sons which they obtained on partition was liable under the Hindu law for the pre partition debt of their father if it was not immoral and under section 53 of the Civil Procedure Code the decreeholder was entitled to execute the decree against such properties.\\r\\nAs no point was raised by the objectors in their petition alleging that the debt covered by the decree was tainted with immorality, the objections under section 47, Civil Procedure Code, were dismissed.\\r\\nThe objectors thereupon took an appeal to the High Court of East Punjab which was heard by Rahman J. sitting singly.\\r\\nThe learned judge dismissed the appeal and affirmed the decision of the Subordinate 549 Judge.\\r\\nA further appeal taken to a Division Bench under the Letters Patent was also dismissed and it is the propriety of the judgment of the Letters Patent Bench that has been challenged before us in this appeal.\\r\\nMr. Kunzru appearing for the appellants put forward a three fold contention in support of the appeal.\\r\\nHe contended in the first place that under the terms of the compromise decree the decreeholder could proceed only against the properties of Baldev Das in the hands of his legal represen tatives and no property belonging to the appellants could be made liable for the satisfaction of the decree.\\r\\nThe second contention put forward is that as the decree in the present case was obtained after partition of the joint family property between the father and his sons, the separate property of the sons obtained on partition was not liable under Hindu law for the debt of the father.\\r\\nIt is urged last of all that in any event if there was any pious obligation on the part of the sons to pay the father \\'s debt incurred before partition, such obligation could be enforced against the sons, only in a properly constituted suit and not by way of execution of a decree obtained in a suit which was brought against the father alone during his lifetime and to which the sons were made parties only as legal representa tives after the father \\'s death.\\r\\nAs regards the first point, the determination of the question raised by Mr. Kunzru depends upon the construction to be put upon the terms of the compromise decree.\\r\\nThe operative portion of the decree as drawn up by the court stands as follows: \"It is ordered that the parties having compromised, a decree in accordance with the terms of the compromise be and the same is hereby passed in favour of the plaintiff against the estate of Baldev Das deceased in possession of his legal representatives.\\r\\nIt is also ordered that the defendants do also pay Rs. 425 7 0, half costs of the suit.\\r\\n\" 71 550 There was no petition of compromise filed by the parties and made part of the decree, but there are on the record two statements, one made by Pannalal, the appellant No. 1, on behalf of himself and his mother, and the other by Lala Haraprasad, the special agent of the plaintiff, setting out terms of the compromise.\\r\\nThe terms are worded much in the same manner as in the decree itself and are to the effect that a decree for the amount in suit together with half costs would be awarded against the property of Baldev Das deceased.\\r\\nIt is argued by Mr. Kunzru that the expression \"estate of Baldev Das deceased\" occurring in the decree must mean and refer to the property belonging to Baldev Das at the date of his death and could not include any property which the sons obtained on partition with their father during the father \\'s lifetime and in respect of which the latter possessed no interest at the time of his death.\\r\\nStress is laid by the learned counsel in this connection on the fact that when the appellants were brought on the record as legal representatives of their deceased father in the mortgage suit, they specifically asserted in their written statement that there was a partition between them and their father long before the date of the suit as a result of which the hypothecated properties were allotted to them.\\r\\nUpon that the plaintiff definitely abandoned her claim to a mortgage decree or to any relief against the joint family and agreed finally to have a money decree executable against the personal assets of Baldev Das in the hands of his heirs.\\r\\nIn these circumstances, it is urged that if it was the intention of the parties that the decreeholder would be entitled to proceed against the separate property of the sons nothing could have been easier than to insert a provi sion to that effect in the compromise decree.\\r\\nThere is undoubtedly apparent force in this contention but there is another aspect of the question which requires consideration.\\r\\nThe terms of the decree that was passed in this suit, though based on the consent of the parties, are precisely the same as are contemplated by section 52 (1) of the Civil procedure Code.\\r\\nIt was a decree for money 551 passed against the legal representatives of a deceased debtor and it provided expressly that the decretal amount was to be realised out of the estate of the deceased in the hands of the legal representatives.\\r\\nIt is argued on behalf of the respondent, and we think rightly, that as the decree fulfils the conditions of section 52 (1) of the Civil Proce dure Code, it would attract all the incidents which attach by law to a decree of that character.\\r\\nConsequently the decreeholder would be entitled to call in aid the provision of section 53 of the Code; and if any property in the hands of the sons, other than what they received by inheritance from their father, is liable under the Hindu law to pay the father \\'s debts, such property could be reached by the de creeholder in execution of the decree by virtue of the provision of section 53 of the Civil Procedure Code.\\r\\nWheth er the property which the sons obtained on partition during the lifetime of the father is liable for a debt covered by a decree passed after partition and whether section 53 has at all any application to a case of this character are ques tions which we have to determine in connection with the second and the third points raised by appellants.\\r\\nSection 53, Civil Procedure Code, it is admitted, being only a rule of procedure, cannot create or take away any substantive right.\\r\\nIt is only when the liability of the sons to pay the debts of their father in certain circumstances exists under the Hindu law, is the operation of the section attracted and not otherwise.\\r\\nThe only other question that can possibly arise by reason of the decree being a compromise decree is, whether the parties themselves have, by agreement, excluded the operation of section 53, Civil Procedure Code.\\r\\nIt is certainly possible for the parties to agree among themselves that the decree should be executed only against a particular property and no other, but when any statutory right is sought to be contracted out, it is necessary that express words of exclusion must be usedl.\\r\\nExclusion cannot be in ferred merely from the fact that the compromise made no reference to such right.\\r\\nAs nothing was said in the compro mise decree in the present case about the 552 right of the decreeholder to avail herself of other provi sions of the Code which might be available to her in law, we cannot say that the plaintiff has by agreement expressly given up those rights.\\r\\nThe first point, therefore, by itself is of no assistance to the appellants.\\r\\nWe now come to the other two points raised by Mr. Kunzru and as they are inter connected they can conveniently be taken up together.\\r\\nThese points involve consideration of the somewhat vexed question relating to the liability of a son under the Hindu law other than that of the Daybhag school to pay the debts of his father, provided they are not tainted with immorality.\\r\\nIn the opinion of the Hindu Smriti writers, debt is not merely a legal obligation, but non payment of debt is a sin, the consequences of which follow the debtor even after his death.\\r\\nA text (1), which is attributed to Brihaspathi, lays down: \"He who having received a sum lent or the like does not repay it to the owner, will be born hereafter in the credi tor \\'s house a slave, a servant, a woman or a quadruped.\\r\\n\" There are other texts which say that a person m debt goes to hell.\\r\\nHindu law givers therefore imposed a pious duty on the descendants of a man including his son, grandson and great grandson to pay off the debts of their ancestor and relieve him of the after death torments consequent on non payment.\\r\\nIn the original texts a difference has been made in regard to the obligation resting upon sons, grand sons and great grandsons in this respect.\\r\\nThe son is bound to discharge the ancestral debt as if it was his own, to gether with interest and irrespective of any assets that he might have received.\\r\\nThe liability of the grandson is much the same except that he has not to pay any interest; but in regard to the great grandson the liability arises only if he received assets from his ancestor.\\r\\nIt is now settled by judicial decisions that there is no difference as between son, grandson and great grandson so far as the obligation to pay the debts of the ancestor is concerned; but none of them has any personal (1) Vide Colebrooke \\'s Digest I, 228, 553 liability in the matter irrespective of receiving any assets (1).\\r\\nThe position, therefore, is that the son is not person ally liable for the debt of his father even if the debt was not incurred for an immoral purpose and the obligation is limited to the assets received by him in his share of the joint family property or to his interest in such property and it does not attach to his self acquisitions.\\r\\nThe duty being religious or moral, it ceases to exist if the debt is tainted with immorality or vice.\\r\\nAccording to the text writers, this obligation arises normally on the death of the father; but even during the father \\'s lifetime the son is obliged to pay his father \\'s debts in certain exceptional circumstances, e.g., when the father is afflicted with disease or has become insane or too old or has been away from his country for a long time or has suffered civil death by becoming an anchorite (2).\\r\\nIt can now be taken to be fairly well settled that the pious liability of the son to pay the debts of his father exists whether the father 1s alive or dead (3).\\r\\nThus it is open to the father during his lifetime, to effect a transfer of any joint family property including the interests of his sons m the same to pay off an antecedent debt not incurred for family necessity or bene fit, provided it is not tainted with immorality.\\r\\nIt is equally open to the creditor to obtain a decree against the father and in execution of the same put up to sale not merely the father \\'s but also the son \\'s interest in the joint estate.\\r\\nThe creditor can make the sons parties to such suit and obtain an adjudication from the court that the debt was a proper debt payable by the sons.\\r\\nBut even if the sons are not made parties, they cannot resist the sale unless they succeed in establishing that the debts were contracted for immoral purposes.\\r\\nThese propositions can be said to be well recognised and reasonably beyond the region of controversy(4).\\r\\nAll of them, however, (1) Vide Masitullah vs Damodar Prasad, 53 I.A. 204.\\r\\n(2) Vide Mayne \\'s Hindu Law, 11th edition, p. 408.\\r\\n(3) Vide Brij Narain vs Mangla Prasad, 51 I.A. 129.\\r\\n(4) Vide Girdharee Lall vs Kantoo Lall, 1 I.A. 321; Maddan Thakoor vs Kantoo Lall, 1 I.A, 333; Suraj Bunsi vs Sheo Prasad, 6 I.A.88; Brij Narain vs Mangla Prosad, 51 I.A. 129.\\r\\n554 have reference to the period when the estate remains joint and there is existence of coparcenership between the father and the son.\\r\\nThere is no question that so long as the family remains undivided the father is entitled to alienate, for satisfying his own personal debts not tainted with immorality, the whole of the ancestral estate.\\r\\nA creditor is also entitled to proceed against the entire estate for recovery of a debt taken by the father.\\r\\nThe position is somewhat altered when there is a disruption of the joint family by a partition between the father and the sons.\\r\\nThe question then arises, whether the sons remain liable for the debt of the father even after the family is divided; and can the creditor proceed against the shares that the sons obtain on partition for realization of his dues either by way of a suit or in execution of a decree obtained against the father alone ? It must be admitted that the law on the subject as developed by judicial decisions has not been always consist ent or uniform and the pronouncements of some of the Judges betray a lack of agreement in their approach to the various questions involved in working out the law.\\r\\nAs regards debts contracted by the father after parti tion, there is no dispute that the sons are not liable for such debts.\\r\\nThe share which the father receives on partition and which after his death comes to his sons, may certainly, at the hands of the latter, be available to the creditors of the father, but the shares allotted on partition to the sons can never be made liable for the post partition debts of the father (1).\\r\\nThe question that is material for our present purpose is, whether the sons can be made liable for an unsecured debt of the father incurred before partition, in respect to which the creditor filed his suit and obtained decree after the partition took place.\\r\\nOn this point admit tedly there is divergence of judicial opinion, though the majority of decided cases are in favour of the view that the separated share of a son remains liable even after partition for the pre partition debts of the father which (1) Vide Mayne \\'s Hindu Law, 11th Edition, 430.\\r\\n555 are not illegal or immoral (1).\\r\\nThe reasons given in support of this view by different Judges are not the same and on the other side there are pronouncements of certain learned Judges, though few in number, expressing the view that once a partition takes place, the obligation of the sons to discharge the debts of their father comes to an end(2).\\r\\nThe minority view proceeds upon the footing that the pious obligation of the son is only to his father and corre sponding to this obligation of the son the father has a right to alienate the entire joint property including the son \\'s interest therein for satisfaction of an antecedent debt not contracted for immoral purposes.\\r\\nWhat the creditor can do is to avail himself of this right of the father and work it out either by suit or execution proceedings; in other words, the remedy of a father \\'s simple contract credi tor during the father \\'s lifetime rests entirely on the right of the father himself to alienate the entire family property for satisfaction of his personal debts.\\r\\nThe father loses this right as soon as partition takes place and after that, the creditor cannot occupy a better position or be allowed to assert rights which the father himself could not possess.\\r\\nThe reasoning in support of the other view which has been accepted in the majority of the decided cases is thus expressed by Waller J. in his judgment in the Madras Full Bench case(3): \"On principle, I can see no reason why a partition should exempt a son \\'s share from liability for a pre parti tion debt for which it was liable before partition.\\r\\nThe creditor advances money to the father on the credit of the joint family property.\\r\\nWhy should he be deprived of all but a fraction of his security by a transaction to which he was not a party and of which he (1) Vide Subramanya vs Sabapathi, ; Anna bat vs Shivappa, ; Jawahar Singh vs parduman, 14 Lab. 399; Atul Krishna vs Lala Nandanji.\\r\\n14 Pat. 732 (F.B.); Bankey Lal vs Durga All 868 (F.B.); Raghunandan vs Matiram, 6 Luck.\\r\\n497 (F.B.).\\r\\n(2) Vide Krishnaswami, vs Ramaswami, ; V.P. Venkanna vs\\r\\nV.S. Deekshatulu, ; Vide also the dissentient judgment of Ayyangar J. in Subramanya vs Sabapa thi, (3)Vide Subramanya vs Sabapathi, at 369 (F.B.).\\r\\n556 was not aware ? and what becomes of the son \\'s pious obliga tion ? It was binding as regards the particular debt before partition; does it cease to apply to that debt simply be cause there has been a partition ?\" The first part of the observation of the learned Judge does not impress us very much.\\r\\nAn unsecured creditor, who has lent money to the father, does not acquire any lien or charge over the family property, and no question of his security being diminished, at all arises.\\r\\nIn spite of his having borrowed money the father remains entitled to alien ate the property and a mere expectation of the creditor however reasonable it may be, cannot be guaranteed by law so long as he does not take steps necessary in law to give him adequate protection.\\r\\nThe extent of the pious obligation referred to in the latter part of the observation of the learned Judge certainly requires careful consideration.\\r\\nWe do not think that it is quite correct to say that the credi tor \\'s claim is based entirely upon the father \\'s power of dealing with the son \\'s interest in the joint estate.\\r\\nThe father \\'s right of alienating the family property for payment of his just debts may be one of the consequences of the pious obligation which the Hindu law imposes upon the sons or one of the means of enforcing it, but it is certainly not the measure of the entire obligation.\\r\\nAs we have said already, according to the strict Hindu theory, the obliga tion of the sons to pay the father \\'s debts normally arises when the father is dead, disabled or unheard of for a long time.\\r\\nNo question of alienation of the family property by the father arises in these events, although it is precisely under these circumstances that the son is obliged to dis charge the debts of his father.\\r\\nAs was said by Sulaiman A.C.J. in the case of Bankey Lal vs Durga Prasad(1): \"The Hindu law texts based the liability on the pious obligation itself and not on the father \\'s power to sell the son \\'s share.\\r\\n\" It is thus necessary to see what exactly is the extent of the obligation which is recognised by the Hindu (1) (9931) 53 All. 868 at 876 (F.B.).\\r\\n557 texts writers in regard to the payment by the son c the pre partition debts of his father.\\r\\nAlmost all the relevant texts on this point are to be found collected in the judg ments of Sulaiman A.C.J. and Mukherji J in the Allahabad Full Bench case referred to above A text of Narada recites(1): \"What is left after the discharge of the father obliga tion and after the payment of the father \\'s debts shall be divided by the brothers so that the father, may not remain a debtor.\\r\\n\" Katyan also says(2): \"The sons shall pay off the debts and the gift,, prom ised by the father and divide the remaining among them selves.\\r\\n\" There is a further passage in Manu(3): \"After due division of the paternal estate if any debt or estate of the father be found out let the brother equally divide the same among themselves.\" According to Yagnavalka(4): \"The sons should divide the wealth and the debts equal lyl.\\r\\n\" It is true that the partition contemplated in these passages is one after the death of the father.\\r\\nbut when ever the partition might take place, the view of the Hindu law givers undoubtedly is that the binding debts on the family property would have to be satisfied or provided for before the coparceners can divide the property.\\r\\nIn Sat Narain vs Das (5), the Judicial Committee pointed out that when the family estate is divided, it is necessary to take account of both the assets and the debts for which the undivided estate is liable.\\r\\nIt was argued in that case on behalf of the appellants that the pious obligation of the sons was an obligation not to object to the alienation of the joint estate by the (1) Narada., 13, 32.\\r\\n(2)Hindu Law in its Sources by Dr. Ganga Nath Jha, Vol.\\r\\nI. p quotation No. 211.\\r\\n(3)Chap.\\r\\nvs 218.\\r\\n(4) J.C.Ghosh \\'s Hindu Law, Vol.\\r\\nH, page 342.\\r\\n(5) (1936) 63 I.A. 384 72 558 father for his antecedent debt unless they were immoral or illegal, but these debts were not a liability on the joint estate for which provision was required to be made before partition.\\r\\nThis contention did not find favour with the Judicial Committee and in their opinion, as they expressed in the judgment, the right thing to do was to make provision for discharge of such liability when there was partition of the joint estate.\\r\\nIf there is no such provision, \"the debts are to be paid severally by all the sons according to their shares of inheritance,\" as enjoined by Vishnu(1).\\r\\nIn our opinion, this is the proper view to take regarding the liability of the sons under Hindu law for the pre partition debts of the father.\\r\\nThe sons are liable to pay these debts even after partition unless there was an arrangement for payment of these debts at the time when the partition took place.\\r\\nThis is substantially the view taken by the Allahabad High Court in the Full Bench case referred to above and it seems to us to be perfectly in accord with the princi ples of equity and justice.\\r\\nThe question now comes as to what is meant by an ar rangement for payment of debts.\\r\\nThe expressions \"bona fide\" and \"mala fide\" partition seem to have been frequently used in this connection in various decided cases.\\r\\nThe use of such expressions far from being useful does not unoften lead to error and confusion.\\r\\nIf by mala fide partition is meant a partition the object of which is to delay and defeat the creditors who have claims upon the joint family property, obviously this would be a fraudulent transaction not binding in law and it would be open to the creditors to avoid it by appropriate means.\\r\\nSo also a mere colourable partition not meant to operate between the parties can be ignored and the creditor can enforce his remedies as if the parties still continued to be joint.\\r\\nBut a partition need not be mala fide in the sense that the dominant intention of the parties was to defeat the claims of the creditors; if it makes no ar rangement or provision for the payment of the just debts payable (1) Vishnu, Chap.\\r\\n6, verse 36.\\r\\n559 out of the joint family property, the liability of the sons for payment of the pre partition debts of the father will still remain.\\r\\nWe desire only to point out that an arrange ment for payment of debts does not necessarily imply that a separate fund should be set apart for payment of these debts before the net assets are divided, or that some additional property must be given to the father over and above his legitimate share sufficient to meet the demands of his creditors.\\r\\nWhether there is a proper arrangement for payment of the debts or not, would have to be decided on the facts and circumstances of each individual case.\\r\\nWe can conceive of cases where the property allotted to the father in his own legitimate share was considered more than enough for his own necessities and he undertook to pay off all his personal debts and release the sons from their obligation in respect thereof.\\r\\nThat may also be considered to be a proper ar rangement for payment of the creditor in the circumstances of a particular case.\\r\\nAfter all the primary liability to pay his debts is upon the father himself and the sons should not be made liable if the property in the hands of the father is more than adequate for the purpose.\\r\\nIf the arrangement made at the time of partition is reasonable and proper, an unse cured creditor cannot have any reason to complain.\\r\\nThe fact that he is no party to such arrangement is, in our opinion, immaterial.\\r\\nOf course, if the transaction is fraudulent or is not meant to be operative, it could be ignored or set aside; but otherwise it is the duty of unsecured creditor to be on his guard lest any family property over which he has no charge or lien is diminished for purposes of realization of his dues.\\r\\nThus, in our opinion, a son is liable, even after partition for the pre partition debts of his father which are not immoral or illegal and for the payment of which no arrangement was made at the date of the partition.\\r\\nThe question now is, how is this liability to be enforced by the creditor, either during the lifetime of the lather or after his death ? It has been held 560 in a large number of cases(1) all of which recognise the liability of the son to pay the pre partition debts of the father that a decree against the father alone obtained after partition in respect of such debt cannot be executed against the property that is allotted to the son on partition.\\r\\nThey concur in holding that a separate and independent suit must be instituted against the sons before their shares can be reached.\\r\\nThe principles underlying these decisions seems to us to be quite sound.\\r\\nAfter a partition takes place, the father can no longer represent the family and a decree obtained against him alone, cannot be binding on the sepa rated sons.\\r\\nIn the second place, the power exercisable by the father of selling the interests of the sons for satis faction of his personal debts comes to an end with parti tion.\\r\\nAs the separated share of the sons cannot be said to belong to the father nor has he any disposing power over it or its profits which he can exercise for his benefit, the provision of section 60 of the Civil Procedure Code would operate as a bar to the attachment and sale of any such property in execution of a decree against the father.\\r\\nThe position has been correctly stated by the Nagpur High Court(2) in the following passages: \"To say a son is under a pious obligation to pay cer tain debts is one thing; to say his property can be taken in execution is another.\\r\\nIn our view, property can only be attached and sold in execution if it falls within the kind of property that can be attached and sold.\\r\\nWhat that is, is found by looking at section 60.\\r\\nWhen one looks at section 60 one finds that the property in question should either belong to the judgment debtor or he should have a disposing power over it.\\r\\nAfter partition, the share that goes to the son does not belong to the father and the father has no dispos ing power over it.\\r\\nTherefore such property does not fall within section. . .\\r\\nIt by no means follows that a son cannot (1) Vide Kameswaramma vs Venkatasubba, 20; Subramanya vs Sabapathi, ; Thirumala Muthu vs Subramania, A.I.R. 1937 Mad. 458; Surajmal vs Motiram ; Atul Krishna vs Lala Nandanji, 14 Pat. 732; Govin dram vs Nathulal, I.L.R,.\\r\\n(2) Jainarayan v, Sonaji, A.I.R. 1938 Nag.\\r\\n24 at 29 561 be made liable.\\r\\nHe could be made liable for his father \\'s debts if he had become a surety; he can be made liable under the pious obligation rule.\\r\\nIn neither of the cases put, could his liability take the form of having his property seized in execution and sold without any prior proceedings brought against him, leaving him to raise the question whether his liability as surety or under the pious obliga tion rule precluded him from claiming in execution.\\r\\n\" It is not disputed that the provision of section 53 of the Civil Procedure Code cannot be extended to a case when the lather is still alive.\\r\\nWe now come to the last and the most controversial point in the case, namely, whether a decree passed against the separated sons as legal representatives of a deceased debtor in respect of a debt incurred before partition can be exe cuted against the shares obtained by such sons at the parti tion ? As has been said already, the shares of the separated sons in the family property may be made liable for pre partition debts, provided they are not tainted with immoral ity and no arrangement for payment of such debts was made at the time the partition.\\r\\nThe question, however, is whether this can be done in execution proceedings or a separate suit has to be brought for this purpose.\\r\\nMr. Kunzru argues that what could not be done during the lifetime of the lather in execution of a decree against him cannot possibly be done alter his death simply because the lather died during the pendency of the suit and the sons were made parties defend ants not in their own right but as representatives of their deceased lather.\\r\\nIt is pointed out that the appellants in the present case were not allowed to raise any plea which could not have been raised by their father and they never had any opportunity to show that they were under Hindu law not liable for these debts.\\r\\nIt is undoubtedly true that no liability can be enforced against the sons unless they are given an opportunity to show that they are not liable for debts under Hindu law; but this opportunity can certainly be given to 562 them in execution proceedings as well.\\r\\nA decree against a father alone during his lifetime cannot possibly be executed against his sons as his legal representatives.\\r\\nAs we have said already, the decree against the father after the parti tion could not be taken to be a decree against the sons and no attachment and sale of the sons \\' separated shares would be permissible under section 60, Civil Procedure Code.\\r\\nThe position, however, would be materially different if the sons are made parties to the suit as legal representatives of their father and a decree is passed against them limited to the assets of the deceased defendant in their hands.\\r\\nA proceeding for execution of such a decree would attract the operation of section 47 of the Civil Procedure Code under which all questions relating to execution, discharge and satisfaction of the decree between the parties to the suit in which the decree was passed or their representatives would have to be decided in execution proceedings and not by a separate suit.\\r\\nSection 52 (1), Civil Procedure Code, provides that when a decree is against the legal representa tives of a dead person and is one for recovery of money out of the properties of the deceased, it may be executed by attachment, and sale of any such property.\\r\\nThen comes sec tion 53 which lays down that \"for purposes of section 50 and section 52 property in the hands of a son or other descend ants which is liable under Hindu law for payment of the debt of a deceased ancestor in respect of which a decree has been passed, shall be deemed to be property of the deceased which has come to the hands of the son or other descendant as his legal representative.\\r\\n\" It is to be noted that before the Civil Procedure Code of 1908 came into force, there was a conflict of opinion as to whether the liability of a Hindu son to pay his father \\'s debts could or could not be enforced in execution proceedings.\\r\\nUnder the Hindu law an undivided son or other descendant who succeeds to the joint property on the death of his father or other ancestor does so by right of survivorship and not as heir.\\r\\nIn the old Code the term \"legal representative\" was not defined and 563 the question arose as to whether the son could be regarded as the legal representative of his father in regard to properties which he got by survivorship on the father \\'s death and whether a decree against the father could be enforced in execution against the son or a separate suit would have to be instituted for that purpose.\\r\\nIt was held by the Madras and the Allahabad High Courts that the liabil ity could not be enforced in execution proceedings, whereas the Calcutta and the Bombay High Courts held otherwise.\\r\\nSection 53 in a sense gives legislative sanction to the view taken by the Calcutta and the Bombay High Courts.\\r\\nOne reason for introducing this section may have been or undoubtedly ,was to enable the decreeholder to proceed in execution against the property that vested in the son by survivorship after the death of the father against whom the decree was obtained; but the section has been worded in such a compre hensive manner that it is wide enough to include all cases where a son is in possession of ancestral property which is liable under the Hindu law to pay the debts of his father; and either the decree has been made against the son as legal representative of the father or the original decree being against the father, it is put into execution against the son as his legal representative under section 50 of the Civil Procedure Code.\\r\\nIn both these sets of circumstances the son is deemed by a fiction of law to be the legal representative of the deceased debtor in respect of the property which is in his hands and which is liable under the Hindu law to pay the debts of the father, although as a matter of fact he obtained the property not as a legal representative of the father at all.\\r\\nAs we said have already, section 53 of the Civil Procedure Code being a rule of procedure does not and cannot alter any principle of substantive law and it does not enlarge or curtail in any manner the obligation which exists under Hindu law regarding the liability of the son to pay his father \\'s debts.\\r\\nIt however lays down the procedure to be followed in cases coming under this SectiOn and if the son is bound under Hindu law to 564 pay the father \\'s debts from any ancestral property in his hands and the section is not limited to property obtained by survivorship a1one the remedy of the decreeholder against such property lies in the execution proceedings and not by way of a separate suit the son would certainty be at liberty to show that the property in his hands is for cer tain reasons not liable to pay the debts of his father and all these questions would have to be decided by the execut ing court under section 47, Civil Procedure Code.\\r\\nThis seems to us to be the true scope and the meaning of section 53, Civil Procedure Code.\\r\\nIn our opinion the correct view on this point was taken by Wort J. in his dissenting judgment in the Full Bench case of Atul Krishna vs Lala Nandanji (1) decided by the Patna High Court.\\r\\nThe majority decision in that case upon which stress is laid by Mr. Kunzru overlooks the point that section 47, Civil Procedure Code, could have no application when the decree against the father is sought to be executed against the sons during his lifetime and consequently the liability of the latter must have to be established in an independent proceeding.\\r\\nIn cases coming under sections 50 and 52 of the Civil Procedure Code on the other hand the decree would be capable of being executed against the sons as legal representatives of their father and it would only be a matter of procedure whether or not these questions should be allowed to be raised by the sons in execution proceedings under section 47, Civil Procedure Code.\\r\\nIt remains only to consider what order should be passed in this case having regard to the principles of law dis cussed above.\\r\\nThe High Court, in our opinion, was quite right in holding that the question of liability of the property obtained by the appellants in their share on parti tion with their father, for the decretal dues is to be determined in the execution proceeding itself and not by a separate suit.\\r\\nIt is not disputed before us that the debt which is covered by the decree in the present case is a pre partition debt.\\r\\nThe sons, (1) (1935) 14 Pat.\\r\\n565 therefore, would be liable to pay the decretal amount, provided the debt was not immoral or illegal and no arrange ment was made for payment of this debt at the time when the partition took place.\\r\\nNeither of these questions has been investigated by the courts below.\\r\\nAs regards the immorality of the debts, it is observed by the High Court that the point was not specifically taken in the objections of the appellants under section 47, Civil Procedure Code.\\r\\nThe validity of the partition again was challenged in a way by the decreeholder in his reply to the objections of the appellants, but the courts below did not advert to the real point that requires consideration in such cases.\\r\\nThe parti tion was not held to be invalid as being a fraud on the debtor but the question was not adverted to or considered whether it made any proper arrangement for payment of the just debts of the father.\\r\\nIn our opinion, the case should be reheard by the trial judge and both the points referred to above should be properly investigated.\\r\\nThe appellants did raise a point regarding their non liability for the decretal debt, in the suit itself when they were brought on the record as legal representatives after the death of their father.\\r\\nThe court, however, did not allow them to raise or substantiate this plea inasmuch as they were held incompe tent to put forward any defence which the father himself could not have taken.\\r\\nHaving regard to the conflicting judicial decisions on the subject, the appellants cannot properly be blamed for not raising this point again in the execution proceedings.\\r\\nWe think that they should now be given an opportunity to do so.\\r\\nThe result is that we set aside the judgments of the courts below and direct that the case should be heard de novo by the Subordinate Judge and that the appellants should be given an opportunity to put in a fresh petition of objection under section 47 of the Civil Procedure Code raising such points as they are competent to raise.\\r\\nThe decreeholder would have the right to reply to the same.\\r\\nThe court shall, after hearing such evidence as the parties might choose to adduce, decide 73 566 first of all whether the property attached is the ancestral property of the appellants and is liable to pay the just debts of their father.\\r\\nIt will consider in this connection whether the debts are illegal or immoral and as such not payable by the sons.\\r\\nIf this question is answered in favour of the appellants, obviously the execution petition will have to be dismissed.\\r\\nIf on the other hand it is found that the sons are liable for this debt, the other question for consideration would be whether there was any proper arrange ment made at the time of the partition for payment of the debts of the father.\\r\\nThe court below will decide these ques tions in the light of the principles which we have indicated above and will dispose of the case in accordance with law.\\r\\nIn the event of the appellants being held liable for payment of the decretal debt, it would be open to the executing court to make an order that the decreeholder should in the first instance proceed against the separate property of the father which was allotted to him on partition and which after his death devolved upon the sons; and only if such property is not sufficient for satisfaction of the decree, then the decree could be executed for the balance against the ancestral property in the hands of the appellants.\\r\\nThere will be no order for costs up to this stage.\\r\\nFurther costs will follow the result.\\r\\n', {'entities': [[6, 28, 'CASE_NUMBER'], [59, 73, 'DATE'], [82, 107, 'COURT'], [111,

Daphtary, Solicitor General of India, (J. B. Dadachanji, with him) for the respondent.\\r\\nDecember 21.\\r\\nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered by PATANJALI SASTRI.C.J.\\r\\nThis is a petition under article 32 of the Constitution for the enforcement of the petition er \\'s fundamental rights under article 19 (1) (f) and article 31(1) alleged to have been violated by the Central Bank of India Ltd., a company incorporated under the Indian Compa nies Act, 1882, and having its registered office at Bombay, (hereinafter referred to as \"the Bank\").\\r\\nIt appears that the petitioner held five shares in the Share capital of the Bank which sold those shales to a 51 392 third party in purported exercise of its right of lien for recovery of a debt due to it from the petitioner, and the transfer was registered in the books of the Bank in the year 1937.\\r\\nThe petitioner thereupon instituted a series of pro ceedings in the High Court at Bombay on its original and appellate jurisdiction challenging the validity of the said sale and transfer.\\r\\nThe latest of these proceedings was a suit filed against the Bank in 1951 wherein the plaint was rejected on 2nd March, 1951, under Order 7, Rule 11 (d), of the Code of Civil Procedure as barred by limitation.\\r\\nThe petitioner now prays that all the adverse orders made in the previous proceedings be quashed and the said High Court be directed to have \"the above suit set down to be heard as undefended and pronounce judgment against the respondent or to make such orders as it thinks fit in relation to the said suit\".\\r\\nIt may be mentioned here that though the aforesaid order rejecting the petitioner \\'s plaint was appealable, the petitioner did not prefer an appeal on the somewhat extraor dinary ground that \"the appeal if filed could not be heard by the Judges of the said Court as all of them were disqual ified from hearing such appeal\" either because of their interest in the Bank or because of their prejudice against him.\\r\\nWe are of opinion that the petitioner has misconceived his remedy and the petition must fail on a preliminary ground.\\r\\nNeither article 19 (1) (f) nor article 31 (1) on its true construction was intended to prevent wrongful individual acts or to provide protection against merely private conduct.\\r\\nArticle 19 deals with the \"right to free dom\" and by clause (1) assures to the citizen certain funda mental freedoms including the freedom \"to acquire, hold and dispose of property\" subject to the power of the State to impose restrictions on the exercise of such rights to the extent and on the grounds mentioned in clauses (2) to (6).\\r\\nThe language and structure of article 19 and its setting in Part III of the Constitution clearly show that the article was intended to protect those freedoms against State action other than in the legitimate exercise of its power to regu late private rights in the public interest, 393 Violation of rights of property by individuals is not within the purview of the article.\\r\\nThe position is no better under article 31 (1).\\r\\nThe petitioner has urged that clause (1) should be construed apart from and independently of the rest of the article and, if so construed, its language is wide enough to cover in fringements of rights of property by private individuals.\\r\\nHe laid emphasis on the omission of the word \"State\" in clause (1) while it was used in clause (2) of the same article as well as in many other articles in Part III.\\r\\nReferring to entry No. 33 of the Union List, entry No. 36 of the State List and entry No, 42 of the Concurrent List of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution, he also argued that, while these entries read with article 246 empowered Parliament and the State Legislatures to make laws regarding acquisition or requisitioning of property for the purposes of the Union or the State as the case may be.\\r\\nno power was conferred to make laws regarding \"deprivation of property\" by the State, so that the \"deprivation\" contemplated in clause (1) could only be deprivation by individuals.\\r\\nSub section (1) of section 299 of the Government of India Act, 1935, corresponding to clause (1) of article a 1 was, it was pointed out, omitted in the draft article 19 (later numbered as article 81) which retained in a modified form only the provision contained in sub section (2) of that section relating to compulsory acquisition of property for public purposes.\\r\\nBut, clause (1) was subsequently restored and article was enacted in its present form as recommended in Drafting Committee \\'s Report and this, it was claimed, showed that clause (1) was intended to operate as a distinct provi sion apart from clause (2).\\r\\nWe see no force in any of these arguments.\\r\\nIn support of the argument that clause (1 ) should be construed in isolation from the rest of the article, the petitioner relied on certain observations of our learned brother Das in Chiranjit Lal vs The Union of India (1), where the view was expressed that clause (1)enunciated the general principle that no person should be deprived (1) [1950] S.C,R,. 860.\\r\\n394 of his property except by authority of law and laid down no condition for payment of compensation, while clause (2) dealt with deprivation of property brought about by acquisi tion or taking possession of it and required payment of compensation.\\r\\nIn other words, deprivation referred to in clause(1) must be taken to cover deprivation otherwise than by acquisition or requisitioning of property dealt with in clause (2).\\r\\nWe consider it unnecessary for the purpose of the present petition to go into that question.\\r\\nEven assuming that clause (1) has to be read and construed apart from clause (2), it is clear that it is a declaration of the fundamental right of private property in the same negative form in which article 21 declares the fundamental right to life and liberty.\\r\\nThere is no express reference to the State in article 21.\\r\\nBut could it be suggested on that account that that article was intended to afford protection to life and personal liberty against violation by private individuals ? The words \"except by procedure established by law\" plainly exclude such a suggestion.\\r\\nSimilarly, the words \"save by authority of law\" in clause (1) of article 31 show that it is a prohibition of unauthorised governmental action against private property, as there can be no question of one private individual being authorised by law to deprive anoth er of his property.\\r\\nThe argument based on the entries in the Lists is fallacious.\\r\\nIt is not correct to suggest that, merely be cause there is no entry in the Lists of the Seventh Schedule relating to \"deprivation of property\" as such, it is not within the competence of the legislatures in the country to enact a law authorising deprivation of property.\\r\\nSuch a law could be made, for instance, under entry No. 1 of List II, entry No. 1 of List II or entry No. 1 of List III.\\r\\nArticle 31 (1) itself contemplates a law being passed authorising deprivation of the properties, and it is futile to deny the existence of the requisite legislative power.\\r\\nNor does the legislative history of the article lend any support to the petitioner \\'s contention.\\r\\nSection 299 395 (1) of the Government of India Act, 1935, was never inter preted as prohibiting deprivation of property by private individuals.\\r\\nIts restoration, therefore, in the same form in article 31, after omission in the original draft article 19, could lead to no inference in support c. of the peti tioner \\'s contention, which indeed proceeds on the fundamen tal misconception that article 19(1)(f) and article 31 (1), which are great constitutional safeguards against State aggression on private property, are directed against in fringements by private individuals for which remedies should be sought in the ordinary law.\\r\\nIn this view it is unnecessary to deal with certain other objections to the maintainability of the petition raised by the Solicitor General on behalf of the Bank.\\r\\nThe petition is dismissed.\\r\\nWe make no order as to costs.\\r\\nPetition dismissed.\\r\\n', {'entities': [[27, 37, 'PROVISION'], [195, 208, 'LAWYER'], [239, 256, 'LAWYER'], [345, 366, 'JUDGE'], [393, 403, 'PROVISION'], [491, 527, 'JUDGE'], [565, 591, 'RESPONDENT'], [691, 697, 'GPE'], [1111, 1131, 'COURT'], [1341, 1356, 'DATE'], [1364, 1384, 'PROVISION'], [2292, 2329, 'PROVISION'], [2462, 2472, 'PROVISION'], [2829, 2839, 'PROVISION'], [3207, 3221, 'PROVISION'], [3841, 3852, 'PROVISION'], [4212, 4242, 'PROVISION'], [4250, 4273, 'STATUTE'], [5061, 5096, 'PRECEDENT'], [5957, 5967, 'PROVISION'], [6067, 6078, 'PROVISION'], [6398, 6408, 'PROVISION'], [7075, 7089, 'PROVISION'], [7347, 7365, 'PROVISION'], [7374, 7397, 'STATUTE'], [7540, 7550, 'PROVISION'], [7737, 7772, 'PROVISION']]}]\n",

Court was delivered by MAHAJAN J.\\r\\nThese appeals are directed against the judgment and decrees of the High Court of Judicature at Calcutta, dated 23rd February, 1945, reversing the judgment and decrees passed by the District Judge of Birbhum dated 16th December, 1938.\\r\\nThe principal questions for determina tion are the same in 102 784 all of them and can be conveniently disposed of by one judgment.\\r\\nIt is necessary to set out briefly the history of this half a century old litigation I The seven suits out of which arise Appeals Nos.\\r\\n68 to 74 were filed in September, 1904, by Maharaja Bahadur Singh in the court of the differ ent Munsifs at Rampurhat, against Raja Ranjit Singh Bahadur, deceased, and others, for a declaration of his title to the lands mentioned in the different suits and for mesne profits from the year 1899 till recovery of possession.\\r\\nIt was alleged that the lands in the several suits were chowkidari chakran lands within the plaintiff \\'s patnidari, granted to his predecessors in interest on 14th November, 1853, by the ancestors of the defendant, that as the lands were in the possession of village watchmen on service tenures, they were excluded from assessment of land revenue and no rent was paid on them, that in the year 1899 under the provisions of sections 50 and 51 of Bengal Act VI of 1870 Government resumed the lands, terminated the service tenures and settled them with the zamindar, that in this situation the plaintiff as patnidar became entitled to their actual physi cal possession, that the zamindar wrongfully took physical possession of them and denied the right of the plaintiff and hence he was entitled to the reliefs claimed.\\r\\nThe suits were decreed on 17th August, 1905, and 19th August, 1905, by the two courts respectively and the decisions were affirmed on appeal by the District Judge.\\r\\nOn special appeal to the High Court, the suits were remanded for trial on the ques tion of limitation, and after remand they were dismissed by the trial court and the Court of appeal as barred by limita tion.\\r\\nOn second appeal, it was held that the suits were within limitation and were then decreed for the second time.\\r\\nThis decision was affirmed on appeal to His Majesty in Council.\\r\\nThe plaintiff actually obtained possession of the lands involved in these suits in August, 1913.\\r\\nAn applica tion was made for ascertainment of mesne profits on 785 6th November, 1918.\\r\\nThis was resisted by the defendant and it was pleaded that the plaintiff was not entitled to inter est on mesne profits, that the zamindar was entitled to receive the profits of the disputed lands and that deduc tion should be made out of the amount of the mesne profits on account of munafa and the amount of chowkidari dues as well as cesses due to him or paid by him.\\r\\nFive years later, on 24th June, 1927, another set of objections was filed by the zamindar claiming deduction out of mesne profits by way of equitable set off of the payments made by him subsequent to the date of delivery possession as well as for the amount of munafa that became payable to him after that date.\\r\\nAfter a prolonged enquiry the trial court on 18th December, 1937, decreed the plaintiff \\'s claim for mesne profits after allow ing the zamindar the deductions claimed by him up to the date of assessment of mesne profits but disallowed the amount claimed by way of equitable set off for the subse quent period.\\r\\nThe learned District Judge on appeal reversed this decision and allowed the defendant the amount claimed by him by way of equitable set off, subject, however, to the condition that the dues of the defendant should be deducted from the dues of the plaintiff till the defendant \\'s dues were wiped off.\\r\\nThe relevant part of his judgment runs thus : \"The broad fact is that they (plaintiffs) have been in possession of the lands since 1910 and have been in enjoy ment of rent from the tenants from that date and according to law they are not entitled to possess the land uncondi tionally.\\r\\nNow that all the facts are before the court and the time has come for final adjustment of accounts between the parties the court should try to do substantial justice between the parties.\\r\\nIt is not sufficient answer to say that the plea of equitable set off was not raised in the beginning.\\r\\nThe circumstances in all these cases are pecul iar and it could hardly be expected that such plea would have been taken in the very beginning.\\r\\nThe course of liti gation in these cases has not run along 786 easy and smooth channels: on the contrary its course has been extremely tortuous and disturbed frequently by con flicting decisions.\\r\\nNo one could have reason ably antici pated in the beginning that the litigation would be pro tracted in this extraordinary way.\\r\\nIt is the duty of the court to take notice of the subsequent events in order to do justice between the parties .\\r\\nAs we are dealing with the question of equitable set off, no question of time barred debts or unascertained sum can arise .\\r\\nThe plea of equitable set off in respect of time barred debts can be set up as a shield by way of defence nor can any question of payment of court fees arise.\\r\\nThere is, in my opinion, no substantial difference in the character of the respective parties during the entire period and it would be futile to make an attempt at distinction by oversubtle argument where there is really no difference in substance.\\r\\nThere is considerable force in the argument advanced on the side of the appellant, namely, the appellant \\'s claim to the equitable set off is really in the nature of cross demand arising out of the same transaction and connected in its nature and circumstances .\\r\\nFrom whatever standpoint the matter may be looked at I am of the opinion that the claim of the appellant for equitable set off for the subsequent period by way of deduction of the chowkidari revenue and cess paid by him as well as on account of munafa should be allowed.\\r\\nThis amount will also carry interest at 6 per cent per annum up to date.\\r\\nThe subsequent period means the period since the date of delivery of possession up to 1927 28.\\r\\n\" Against the judgment and decrees of the District Judge the plaintiff preferred appeals to the High Court at Calcut ta.\\r\\nThe High Court by the judgment under appeal modified the decrees of the District Judge and disallowed the claim for equitable set off in its entirety for the subsequent period and restored the decree of the trial court.\\r\\nThe zamindar filed applications for leave to appeal to His Majesty in Council.\\r\\nThese applications were consolidated with similar applications filed in the second batch of suits.\\r\\nA certifi cate 787 was granted for leave to appeal to His Majesty in Council.\\r\\nBy an order dated 9th June, 1947, all the appeals were admitted and it was directed that the proceedings be printed and.\\r\\ntransmitted to England.\\r\\nDuring the pendency of the proceedings in the High Court, Raja Bhupendra Narayan Singh died and the present appellant was impleaded as his heir and representative.\\r\\nAn application was also made in the High Court for permission to urge additional grounds not already taken.\\r\\nAfter the abolition of the jurisdiction of the Privy Council these appeals were transmitted to this Court.\\r\\nAn application under Order XIX, rule 4, of the Supreme Court Rules was presented at the hearing of the appeals that the appellant be allowed to urge the following additional grounds in support of the appeals, viz. : (1) That the munafa (rent) should not be calculated on the basis of the principles laid down in Radhacharan vs Maharaja Ranjit Singh(1).\\r\\n(2) That the said munafa should have been assessed on a fair share of the profits from the land.\\r\\nThe second batch of appeals (Nos. 75 to 92 of 1951) arises out of 18 suits instituted in the court of the Munsif of Rampurhat on 22nd December, 1909, by Ganpat Singh and Narpat Singh, predecessors in interest of respondents 1 to 3 against the predecessor in interest of the appellant, late Raja Ranjit Singh Bahadur, and also some other persons who were tenants under him, for a declaration of the plaintiffs \\' title to the resumed chowkidari chakran lands and for khas possession of the same and for mesne profits.\\r\\nThe allega tions in these suits were the same as in the first set of suits.\\r\\nThe defence to the suits was also the same.\\r\\nThe suits were decreed by the trial Judge on 30th September, 1910, in the following terms : \"The plaintiffs \\' title is declared to the lands in suit and they will get khas possession of the same by ejecting the tenant defendants; on condition of paying (1) 788 to the defendant No. 1 an additional rent, to be deter mined on the principle that the original patni rent should bear the same ratio to the patni rent now payable by the plaintiffs as the original Hustbood at the time of the creation of the patni should bear to the present increased Hustbood, or any other fair and equitable rent which may be determined at the time of assessing the mesne profits.\\r\\nThe plaintiffs will get Wasilat from defendant No. 1 up to the date of delivery of possession of the land in suit to them.\\r\\nThe amount will be determined in a separate enquiry.\" The District Judge on appeal remanded the cases for determination of the conditions and terms under which the patnidar was to hold the lands under the zamindar and directed ascertainment of profits.\\r\\nThe plaintiffs ob tained delivery of possession of the lands in the mean while on 23rd November, 1910.\\r\\nAgainst the remand order appeals were preferred to the High Court and the High Court decreed the appeals in these terms : \"We set aside the portion of the decision of the Dis trict Judge which remands the cases to the original court to determine the conditions under which the patnidar is to hold the lands under the zamindar.\\r\\nRest of the remand order will stand.\\r\\nThat portion of the Munsif \\'s decree, which imposes on the appellant, as a condition of obtain ing khas possession, the payment of additional rent to the zamindar will be set aside.\\r\\n\" Against these decrees appeals were preferred to His Majesty in Council by special leave.\\r\\nThe Privy Council set aside the decrees of the High Court and observed as follows : \"Their Lordships, therefore, see no reason for inter fering with the long series of authorities commencing as far back as the year 1900, which have established the right of the zamindar to have an additional rent fixed for such lands nor can their Lordships overlook the fact that in the cases already referred before this Board no exception was taken by the patnidar to the 789 fixing of such rents as a condition of being put into pos session.\\r\\n\" On 8th December, 1922, the plaintiffs filed applications in these suits for ascertainment of mesne profits for the years 1906 to 1910.\\r\\nObjections were taken on behalf of the defendant on the 17th April, 1923, and it was contended that the plaintiffs may be allowed mesne profits to the extent of the amount that would be found due after deduction of the amount of rent to which the defendant was entitled in re spect of the lands in suit according to the judgment of the munsif.\\r\\nOn the 28th May, 1927, another application was filed by the zamindar claiming deduction by way of equitable set off of the amounts due to him for rent from 1910 onwards and on account of subsequent payment made by him towards revenue and cesses.\\r\\nAfter a prolonged enquiry the munsif ultimately on the 18th December, 1937, decreed the plaintiff \\'s claim for mesne profits after allowing deduc tions for the amounts claimed by the defendant up to the date of delivery of possession.\\r\\nHe held that the appellant was not entitled to get any amount by way of equitable set off in respect of sums of money spent by him in payment of revenue and cesses or for the amount of munafa or profits for the period subsequent to the date of delivery of posses sion.\\r\\nThe District Judge on appeal by his judgment dated the 16th December, 1938, allowed the claim of equitable set off for the period subsequent to delivery of possession and directed that \"from the plaintiffs dues, the dues of the defendant are to be deducted and if after these deduc tions any sum is due to the plaintiffs they will get a decree for that sum.\\r\\nIf it is found on calculations in some cases that the dues of the defendant exceed the dues of the plaintiffs, in such cases the prayer of the plaintiffs for mesne profits must be dismissed.\\r\\n\" Against this decision special appeals were preferred to the High Court and by the judgment under appeal the decision of the trial court was restored.\\r\\nApplications were then made for leave to appeal to His Majesty in Council and 790 those were allowed and a certificate was granted for pre ferring those appeals.\\r\\nBecause of the abolition of the jurisdiction of the Privy Council those appeals are now before us for decision.\\r\\nThe points for decision in all these appeals are the following : 1.\\r\\nWhether the appellant is entitled to deduct by way of equitable set off from the amount of mesne profits the amounts due to him on account of rent, revenue and cesses for the period subsequent to the dates of delivery of pos session.\\r\\nWhether interest should be allowed on the amount of mesne profits found due, and if so, at what rate.\\r\\nWhether the rent due to the appellant from the patnidar on those funds should be calculated on the basis of annual assets of the land (as in Radhacharan vs Maharaja Ranjit Singh (1), or on a fair and equitable basis.\\r\\nThe claim for set off for the period for which mesne profits were claimed has been allowed and is not in these appeals.\\r\\nAs regards the amounts due to the appellant by way of rent subsequent to the date of transfer of possession, the claim is unconnected with the subjectmatter of the different suits.\\r\\nIt seems clear that a plea in the nature of equita ble set off is not available when the cross demands do not arise out of the same transaction.\\r\\nMesne profits due to the plaintiff relate to the period during which the appellant was in wrongful possession of the lands and the amounts claimed by the defendant relate tO a period when he was no longer in possession and had ceased to be a trespasser.\\r\\nNo mesne profits are claimable for that period.\\r\\nThe right of the appellant to recover additional rents from the plaintiff arises out of a different cause of action and independently of the claim for mesne profits.\\r\\nIf the patnidar after having entered into possession had defaulted in the payment of the (1) (1918)27 C.L J. 532, 791 additional rents due for any period, nothing stood in the way of the appellant from recovering the.\\r\\nin by appropriate legal proceedings.\\r\\nThe prolongation of the enquiry for ascertainment of the mesne profits cannot support a claim for equitable set off for the period subsequent to the delivery of possession to the plaintiff.\\r\\nIt is obvious that no claim for equitable set off against mesne profits during the pendency of the suits could be made for the sums deduction of which is now sought, as the amounts had not then accrued due and his right to them had not yet arisen.\\r\\nThe learned District Judge was in error in holding that the appellant \\'s claim for equitable set off was in the nature of a cross demand arising out of the same transaction and connected in its nature and circumstances.\\r\\nHe failed to appreciate that the transaction which led to plaintiff \\'s demand resulted from the defendant \\'s wrongful act as a trespasser, while the transaction giving rise to the appellant \\'s demand arises out of the relationship of landlord and tenant and the obligations resulting therefrom.\\r\\nA wrongdoer who has wrongfully withheld moneys belonging to another cannot invoke any principles of equity in his favour and seek to deduct therefrom the amounts that during this period have fallen due to him.\\r\\nThere is nothing improper or unjust in telling the wrongdoer to undo his wrong, and not to take advantage of it.\\r\\nSuch a person cannot be helped on any principles of equity to recover amounts for the recovery of which he could have taken action in due course of law and which for some unexplained reason he failed to take and which claim may have by now become barred by limitation.\\r\\nIt was contended that it was only after the decree of the Privy Council that the appellant \\'s rights to the addi tional rent was finally established and till then no legal steps could be taken to enforce this demand.\\r\\nThe contention is without force.\\r\\nThe appellant \\'s right to additional rent had been established by the decree of the trial court in execution of which possession passed from him to the patni dar.\\r\\nThe Privy 103 792 Council only affirmed this.decision.\\r\\nThe patnidars under the decree were entitled to possession of the lands conditional on payment of the additional rent due for the period they had been out of possession.\\r\\nThat condition having been fulfilled (by adjustment of the appellant \\'s claim against the mesne profits), the decree must be held to have been satisfied, thus completely settling the cross demands.\\r\\nThe landlord \\'s demand for subsequent rents has to be enforced in the ordinary way in the civil court if any default has been committed in the payment of these rents.\\r\\nThis claim cannot for ever remain linked with the demand for mesne profits for any anterior period.\\r\\nThe result is that the decision of the High Court on this point is maintained.\\r\\nOn the question of future interest payable on the decretal amount, the learned District Judge observed as follows : \"I may state, however, at this stage that if I were to rule out the fact that I am allowing the claim of the appel lant for equitable set off, I would have allowed interest to the plaintiffs at the uniform rate of 4 per cent.\\r\\nper annum throughout, i.e., from the beginning of the Washilat period up to date.\\r\\nAs I am allowing the prayer for equitable set off, I am of opinion, however, that interest at the usual rate at 6 per cent.\\r\\nper annum should be granted for the whole of this period.\\r\\n\" The High Court disallowed equitable set off but yet maintained this decision.\\r\\nWhen the claim for equitable set off is being disallowed, there is no justification for allowing future interest at the rate of more than four per cent.\\r\\nfor such a long period, particularly in a case where the plaintiff himself has not been prompt in getting, the amount of mesne profits ascertained.\\r\\nThe plaintiff did not even ask for an enquiry into this question for a period of about twelve years.\\r\\nTaking into consideration all the circumstances of the case we think that future interest should not have been allowed to the plaintiff in the several suits at a higher rate than four per cent.\\r\\non the amount decreed in the various Suits by way of mesne profits.\\r\\n793 The appellant \\'s last contention that the munafa (rent) should not be calculated on the principle laid down in Radhacharan vs Maharaja Ranjit Singh (1) but should have been assessed on a fair share of the profits of the land has no substance because the claim was not made in the grounds of appeal to the Privy Council and was not even mentioned in the additional grounds of appeal.\\r\\nIt was for the first time made before us at the hearing and we see no valid grounds for entertaining it at this late stage.\\r\\nMoreover, it seems to us that the claim has no substance in the absence of any evidence about the proportion the original patni rent bore to the revenue and cesses.\\r\\nFor the reasons given above all these appeals fail except to the extent that the decree of the High Court is modified in that the amounts decreed by way of mesne profits in the various suits will bear interest at the rate of four per cent.\\r\\ninstead of six per cent.\\r\\nThe parties will bear their own costs in all these appeals.\\r\\nAppeals dismissed.\\r\\nAgent for the appellant in Civil Appeals No. 62 to 74 and 75 to 92: P.K.

No. 5 of 1948.\\r\\nThe appeal was originally filed as Federal Court Appeal No. 71 of 1948 on a certificate granted by the Patna High Court under cl. 31 of the Letters Patent of that High Court that the case was a fit one for appeal to the Federal Court.\\r\\nH.P. Sinha (S.C. Sinha, with him) for the appellant.\\r\\nS.K. Mitra (section L. Chibber, with him) for the respondent.\\r\\nNovember 30.\\r\\nThe judgment of the Court was deliv ered by FAzL ALl J.\\r\\n800 FAZL ALI J.\\r\\nThis is an appeal from an order of the High Court of Judicature at Patna dated the 9th September, 1948, declining to call upon the board of Revenue to state a case under section 21 (3) of the Bihar Sales Tax Act, 1944 (Act VI of 1944), with reference to an assessment made under that Act.\\r\\nThe Bihar Sales Tax Act was passed in 1944, and section 4 of the Act provides that \"every dealer whose gross turn over during the year immediately preceding the commencement of the Act exceeded Rs. 5,000 shall be liable to pay tax under the Act on sales effected after the date so notified.\\r\\n\" It is not disputed that, having regard to the definitions of dealer, goods and sale under the Act, the appellant, who has been doing contract work on a fairly extensive scale for the Central Public Works Department and the East Indian Railway, comes within the category of a dealer mentioned in section 4.\\r\\nSection 7 of the Act provides that \"no dealer shall, while being liable under section 4 to pay tax under the Act, carry on business as a dealer unless he has been registered under the Act and possesses a registration certificate\".\\r\\nIn pursuance of this provision, the appellant filed an applica tion for registration on the 19th December, 1944, and a certificate of registration was issued to him on the 21st December, 1944.\\r\\nOn the 8th October, 1945, the Sales Tax Officer issued a notice to the appellant asking him to produce his accounts on 10th November, 1945, and to show cause why in addition to the tax to be finally assessed on him a penalty not exceeding one and a half times the amount should not be imposed on him under section 10 (5) of the Act.\\r\\nSection 10 (5), under which the notice purported to have been issued, runs thus: \"If upon information which has come into his posses sion, the Commissioner is satisfied that any dealer has been liable to pay tax under this Act in respect of any period and has nevertheless wilfully failed to apply for registra tion, the Commissioner shall, alter giving the dealer a reasonable opportunity of being heard, assess, to the best of his judgment, the amount of tax, if any, due from the dealer in respect of such 801 period and all subsequent periods and the Commissioner may direct that the dealer shall pay, \\'by way of, penalty, in addition to the amount so assessed, a sum not exceeding one and a half times that amount.\\r\\n\" The appellant appeared before the Sales Tax Officer in response to this notice, but obtained several adjournments till 16th March, 1046, and ultimately failed to appear.\\r\\nThereupon, he was assessed by the Sales Tax Officer, accord ing to the best of his judgment, and was ordered to pay Rs. 4,526 13 0 as tax and a penalty amounting to one and a half times the amount assessed, under section 10 (5) of the Act.\\r\\nThe appellant appealed to the Commissioner against the assessment and the penalty levied upon him, but his appeal was dismissed on the 6th June, 1946.\\r\\nHe then filed a peti tion for revision to the Board of Revenue, against the order of the Commissioner, but it was dismissed on the 28th May, 1947.\\r\\nHe thereupon moved the Board of Revenue to refer to the High Court certain questions of law arising out of is order of the 28th May, but Mr. N. Baksi, a Member of the Board, by his order of the 4th December, 1947, rejected the petition with the following observations : \"No case for review of my predecessor \\'s order made out.\\r\\nNo reference necessary.\\r\\n\" Section 21 of the Act provides that if the Board of Revenue refuses to make a reference to the High Court, the applicant may apply to the High Court against such refusal, and the High Court, if it is not satisfied that such refusal was justified, may require the Board of Revenue to state a case and refer it to the High Court.\\r\\nThe section also provides that \"the High Court upon the hearing of any such case shall decide the question of law raised thereby, and shall deliver its judgment thereon containing the grounds on which such decision is founded, and shall send to the Board of Revenue a copy of such judg ment under the seal of the Court . . and the Board shall dispose of the case accordingly.\\r\\n\" In accordance with this section, the appellant made an application to the High Court praying that the Board of Revenue may be called upon to state a case and refer 802 it to the High Court.\\r\\nDealing with this application, the High Court pointed out that the Member of the Board had not been asked to review his predecessor \\'s order but only to state a case, and gave the following directions : \"The ease must, therefore, go back to the Board of Revenue for a case to be stated or for a proper ,order rejecting the application to be passed.\" The Board then reheard the matter and rejected the application of the appellant and refused to state a case and refer it to the High Court.\\r\\nThe appellant thereafter made an application to the High Court for requiring the Board of Revenue to state a case, but this application was summarily rejected.\\r\\nHe then applied to the High Court for leave to appeal to the Federal Court, which the High Court granted, following the decision of a Full Bench of the Lahore High Court in Feroze Shah Kaka Khd vs Income tax Commissioner, punjab and N.W.F.P., Lahore The High Court pointed out in the order granting leave that in the appeal that was taken to the Privy Council in the Lahore case, an objection had been raised as to the competency of the appeal, but the Privy Council, while dismissing the appeal on the merits, had made the following observation: \" The objection is a serious one.\\r\\nAdmittedly such an appeal as the present is not authorized by the Income tax Act itself.\\r\\nIf open at all, it must be justified under clause \"9, Letters Patent of the Lahore High Court, as being an appeal from a final judgment, decree or order made in the exercise of original jurisdiction by a Division Bench of the High Court.\\r\\nAnd this present appeal was held by the Full Court to be so justified.\\r\\nBefore the Board the question was not fully argued, and their Lordships accordingly refrain from expressing any opinion whatever upon it\" (2).\\r\\nThe High Court in granting leave to the appellant seems to have been influenced mainly by the fact that the view of the Lahore High Court had not been held by the Privy Council to be wrong.\\r\\n(1) A.I.R. 1981 Lah.\\r\\n(2) A.I.R. 1933 P. C. 198.\\r\\n803 At the commencement of the hearing of the appeal in this Court, a preliminary objection was raised by the learned counsel for the respondent that this appeals was not compe tent, and, on hearing both the parties, we are of the opin ion that the objection is wellfounded.\\r\\nIn Sri Mahanth Harihar Gir vs Commissioner of Income tax, Bihar and Orissa (1) it was held by a special Bench of the Patna High Court that no appeal lay to His Majesty in Council under clause 31 of the Letters Patent of the Patna High Court, from an order of the High Court dismissing an application under section 66 (3) of the Income tax Act, (a provision similar to section 21 of the Act before us) to direct the Commissioner of Income tax to state a case.\\r\\nIn that case, the whole law on the subject has been clearly and exhaustively dealt with, and it has been pointed out that the view taken by the Full Bench of the Lahore High Court in the case cited by the appellant was not supported by sever al other High Courts and that the Privy Council also, when the matter came before it, refrained from expressing any opinion as to its correctness.\\r\\nIn our opinion, the view expressed in the Patna case is correct.\\r\\nClause 31 of the Letters Patent of the Patna High Court, on the strength of which the appellant resists the prelimi nary objection raised by the respondent, runs thus : \"And We do further ordain that any person or persons may appeal to Us, Our heirs and successors, in Our or Their Privy Council, in any matter not being of criminal juris diction, from any final judgment, decree, or order of the said High Court of Judicature at Patna, made on appeal and from any final judgment, decree on order made in the exercise of original jurisdiction by Judges of the said High Court or of any Division Court, from which an appeal does not lie to the said High Court under the provisions contained in the 10th clause of these (1) A.I.R. 1941 Prat.\\r\\n804 presents: provided, in either case, that the sum or matter at issue is of the amount or value of not less than ten thousand rupees, or that such judgment,decree or order involves, directly or indirectly, some claim, demand or question to or respecting property amounting to or of the value of not less than ten thousand rupees; or from any other final judgment, aecree or order made either on appeal or otherwise as aforesaid, when the said High Court declares that the case is a fit one for appeal to Us . \" In order to attract the provisions of this clause, it is necessary to show, firstly, that the order under appeal is a final order; and secondly, that it was passed in the exer cise of the original or appellate jurisdiction of the High Court.\\r\\nThe second requirement clearly follows from the concluding part of the clause.\\r\\nIt seems to us that the order appealed against in this case, cannot be regarded as a final order, because it does not of its own force bind or affect the rights of the parties.\\r\\nAll that the High Court is required to do under section 21 of the Bihar Sales Tax Act is to decide the question of law raised and send a copy of its judgment to the Board of Revenue.\\r\\nThe Board of Revenue then has to dispose of the case in the light of the judgment of the High Court.\\r\\nIt is true that the Board \\'s order is based on what is stated by the High Court to be the correct legal position, but the fact remains that the order of the High Court standing by itself does not affect the rights of the parties, and the final order in the matter is the order which is passed ultimately by the Board of Revenue.\\r\\nThis question has been fully dealt with in Tata Iron and Steel Company vs Chief Revenue Authority, Bombay(1), where Lord Atkinson pointed out that the order made by the High Court was merely advisory and quoted the following observations of Lord Esher in In re Knight and the Tabernacle Permanent Building Society(2): \"In the case of Ex parte County Council of Kent, where a statute provided that a case might be stated (1) at 617. 805 for the decision of the Court it was held that though the language might prima facie import that there has to be the equivalent of a judgment or order, yet when the context was looked at it appeared that the jurisdiction of the Court appealed to was only consultative, and that there was noth ing which amounted to a judgment or order.\\r\\n\" It cannot also be held that the order was passed by the High Court in this case in the exercise of either original or appellate jurisdiction.\\r\\nIt is not contended that the matter arose in the exercise of the appellate jurisdiction of the High Court, because there was no appeal before it.\\r\\nNor can the matter, properly speaking, be said to have arisen in the exercise of the original jurisdiction of the High Court, as was held by the Judges of the Lahore High Court in the case to which reference was made, because the proceeding did not commence in the High Court as all origi nal suits and proceedings should commence.\\r\\nBut the High Court acquired jurisdiction to deal with the case by virtue of an express provision of the Bihar Sales Tax Act.\\r\\nThe crux of the matter therefore is that the jurisdiction of the High Court was only consultative and was neither original nor appellate.\\r\\nIn this view, the appeal must be dismissed, though on hearing the parties, it appeared to us that the salestax authorities including the Commissioner and the Board of Revenue were in error in imposing a penalty upon the appel lant under section 10 15) of the Act which had no applica tion to his case, inasmuch as he had been registered as required by section 7 of the Act.\\r\\nIn the circumstances, while dismissing the appeal, we make no order as to costs.\\r\\nAppeal dismissed.\\r\\nAgent for the respondent:\\r\\nK.

Fazl Ali and Mukherjea JJ.\\r\\ndelivered separate judgments.\\r\\nPATANJALI SASTRI J.\\r\\nThis is an appeal from a judgment of the High Court of Judicature in West Bengal reversing a finding of the Second Subordinate Judge of 24 Parganas at Alipore that he had jurisdiction to proceed with a suit after substituting the Province of East Bengal (in Pakistan)in the place of the old Province of Bengal against which the suit had originally been brought.\\r\\nThe facts leading to the institution of the suit are not in dispute.\\r\\nThe Bengal Agricultural Income tax Act was passed by the Provincial Legislature of Bengal in 1944.\\r\\nIt applied to the whole of Bengal and purported to bring under charge the agricultural income of, inter alia, \"every Ruler of an Indian State.\" Acting under the provisions of that Act, which came into force on 1st April, 1944, the Income tax Officer, Dacca Range, sent by registered post, a notice to the Manager of the Zemindari Estate called Chakla Roshanabad belonging to the Tripura State but situated in Bengal outside the territories of that State, calling upon him to furnish a return of the total income derived in the 5 previous year from lands in the Estate used for agricultural purposes.\\r\\nThe notice was received by the Manager at Agar talla in Tripura State.\\r\\nThereupon, the State, by its then Ruler, Maharaja Sir Bir Bikram Bahadur, instituted the suit in question on 12th June, 1945, against the Province of Bengal and the Agricultural Income tax Officer, Dacca Range, in the Court of the First Subordinate Judge, Dacca, contest ing the validity of the notice and the proposed assessment on the grounds that the \"Provincial Legislature of Bengal had no authority to impose tax on any income of an Indian State or its Ruler\" and that, in any case, \"the Income tax Officer, Dacca Range, had no authority or jurisdiction to issue the said notice to the Manager of the Estate outside British India.\\r\\n\" The cause of action of the suit was alleged to have arisen in the town of Dacca within the jurisdiction of the Court on 28th February, 1945, when the notice was issued.\\r\\nThe reliefs sought were a declaration that the Bengal Agricultural Income tax Act: 1944, in so far as it purported to impose a liability to pay agricultural income tax on the plaintiff as a Ruler of an Indian State was ultra vires and void and that, in any case, the notice served by the Agricultural Income tax Officer, Dacca Range, was void and no assessment could be made on the basis of such notice, and a perpetual injunction to restrain the defendants from taking any steps to assess the plaintiff to agricultural income tax.\\r\\nBefore the defendants filed their written state ments the suit was transferred by the High Court to the Court of the District Judge, 24 Parganas, and was again transferred from that Court to the Court of the Subordinate Judge at Alipore.\\r\\nThe ruler who brought the suit having died, the plaint was amended by the substitution in his place of his son and heir in June 1947, and the suit was pending in that Court when the partition of India took effect on the 15th August, 1947 On 9th December, 1947, the Province of East Bengal filed a petition stating that the Province of Bengal, the original defendant No. 1 in the suit, had ceased to exist with effect from 15th August, 1947, and 6 in lieu thereof two new Provinces, namely, the Province of East Bengal and the Province of West Bengal had come into existence and that, inasmuch as the Province of West Bengal was taking no interest in the suit, it was necessary in the interests of East Bengal that the suit should be contested and that a written statement should be put in on its behalf for such contest.\\r\\nIt was accordingly prayed that the \\' delay should be condoned and the written statement which was filed with that petition should be accepted.\\r\\nIn the written statement it was pleaded that inasmuch as the Province of East Bengal was a Province of the; Dominion of Pakistan and that defendant No. 2 was a Revenue officer of that Province, the Court had no jurisdiction to hear the suit or make an order of injunction against the defendants.\\r\\nIt was stated that the Province of East Bengal appeared only to contest the jurisdiction of the Court.\\r\\nBy another written statement filed on the same day defendant No. 2 raised also other pleas in defence but his name was struck off the record at the plaintiff \\'s instance as not being a necessary party to the suit.\\r\\nOn the 10th December, 1947, the Province of East Bengal was substituted as the defendant in the place of the Province of Bengal which had ceased to exist, and the writ ten statement filed on behalf of the former was accepted.\\r\\nThereupon the Subordinate Judge framed a preliminary issue on the question of jurisdiction and, as stated al ready, found it for the plaintiff relying on section 9 of the Indian Independence Act and article 4 of the Indian Inde pendence (Legal Proceedings) Order, 1947.\\r\\nIt may be men tioned in passing that the assessment of the plaintiff was proceeded with by the Agricultural Income tax Officer, Comilla Range (East Bengal), who, by his order dated the 22nd December, 1947, imposed on the plaintiff a tax of Rs. 1,79,848 12 0 for 1944 45 and Rs. 1,34,326 7 0 for 1945 46, but the recovery of the amounts has been deferred under orders of the Court pending the decision on the preliminary issue.\\r\\nAs pointed out by the Federal Court in Midnapore 7 Zemindary Co. Ltd. vs The Province of Bengal and ,Others (1), the orders promulgated on the 14th August, 1947, by the Governor General of India before the partition in exercise of the powers conferred under section 9 of the Indian Independ ence Act, 1947, and containing provisions specially designed to remove the difficulties arising in connection with the transition to the new situation created by the partition are binding on both the Dominion of India and the Dominion of Pakistan.\\r\\nAmong such Orders those relevant to the present controversy are the Indian Independence (Legal Proceedings) Order, 1947, and the Indian Independence (Rights, Property and Liabilities)Order, 1947.\\r\\nBy article 4 of the former Order (1) All proceedings pending immediately before the appointed day in any of the special tribunals specified in col. 1 of the Schedule to this Order shall be continued in that tribunal as if the said Act had not been passed, and that tribunal shall continue to have for the purposes of the said proceedings all the jurisdiction and powers which it had immediately before the appointed day; * * * * (3) Effect shall be given within the territories of either of the two Dominions to any order or sentence of any such Special Tribunal as aforesaid and of any High Court in appeal or revision therefrom as if the order or sentence had been passed by a court of competent jurisdiction in that Dominion; * * * * and by article 12 (2) of the latter Order Where any Province from which property, rights or li abilities are transferred by this Order is, immediately before the transfer a party to legal proceedings with re spect to that property or those rights or liabilities the Province which succeeds to the property, rights or liabili ties in accordance with the provisions of this Order shall be deemed to be substituted for the other Province as a party to those proceedings and the proceedings may continue accordingly.\\r\\n(1) 8 On the effect of these provisions the learned Judges of the High Court observed: \"If this provision [i.e., article 12 (2)] applies to the present case, there can be no doubt that the Province of East Bengal was substituted in the suit for the Province of Bengal by operation of law, and by reason of the Legal Proceedings Order the suit shall continue in the Court of the Second Subordinate Judge, 24 Parganas, as a suit against the substituted defendant.\\r\\n\" With that statement of the position we entirely agree.\\r\\nThe learned Judges, however, proceeded to examine, laying stress on the words \"by this Order\" in article 12 (2), whether any property, rights or liabilities could be said to have been transferred by the Indian Independence (Rights, Property and Liabilities) Order, 1947, from the Province of Bengal to the Province of East Bengal, and they took the view that neither any property, nor rights, nor liabilities were so transferred under that Order and that, therefore, the con tinuation of the proceedings against the Province of East Bengal, which was now part of an Independent Sovereign State, was governed by the principles of international law and comity of nations, and that, according to those princi ples, East Bengal, being a Province of a sovereign state, could not be sued against its will in the municipal courts of India, with the result that the suit pending in the Court at Alipore must abate.\\r\\nThey also negatived a further con tention raised before them, apparently for the first time, to the effect that by reason of the petition filed on behalf of the Province of East Bengal for acceptance of its written statement condoning the delay involved and also by reason of sundry other proceedings for interim relief sought by the plaintiff which were actively resisted by the Province of East Bengal, that Province must be taken to have submitted to the jurisdiction of the Court.\\r\\nOn behalf of the appel lant, Mr. Sen Gupta challenged the correctness of the deci sion on both points.\\r\\nBefore dealing with these contentions, it will be con venient to dispose of two preliminary points raised by Mr. Faiyaz Ali, Advocate General of East Bengal.\\r\\n9 In the first place, he submitted that the State of Tripura having since been merged in the Dominion of India and a Chief Commissioner having been appointed to administer its territories, the appeal could no longer be prosecuted by the present Maharaja through his mother as his next friend.\\r\\nIt was, however, represented to us on his behalf that under the agreement of merger the Estate of Chakla Roshanabad was left to the Maharaja as his personal property and it no longer formed part of the territories of the Tripura State.\\r\\nThe Attorney General, appearing on behalf of the Dominion of India, the intervener, confirmed that position.\\r\\nThere is thus no substance in the objection as any formal defect in the proceeding could be set right by suitably amending the cause title.\\r\\nMr. Faiyaz Ali next drew our attention to the Pakistan (Indian Independence Legal Proceedings) Order, 1948, promul gated by the Governor General of Pakistan on 13th November, 1948, with retrospective effect from the 15th August, 1947, and pointed out that in view of its provisions any decree that might eventually be passed by the Court at Alipore would receive no effect in Pakistan and that, therefore, it was unnecessary for this Court to decide the question of the jurisdiction of the Alipore Court to proceed with the suit.\\r\\nWe are unable to take that view.\\r\\nThe effect of the Order referred to above on any decree that may eventually be passed in the pending suit may have to be taken note of by the Court trying that suit after hearing arguments on the validity of that Order which is challenged but we are at present concerned only with the question of the jurisdic tion of that Court to try the suit and we cannot at this stage refuse to give our ruling on that question merely because any decree that might be passed in favour of the plaintiff might prove ineffectual.\\r\\nTurning now to the main question, it is clear that article 12 (2) of the Rights, Property and Liabilities Order applies only to property rights or liabilities which were transferred by the Order from a Province which was a party to legal proceedings 2 10 \"with respect to\" that property or those rights or liabili ties.\\r\\nAs the suit in question cannot be said to have been instituted with respect to the property transferred, namely, Chakla Roshanabad, the appellant cannot rely upon the trans fer of that property from the Province of Bengal to the Province of East Bengal as part of the territories of Pakistan under the scheme of partition.\\r\\nNor was there any transfer of \"rights\"such as was contemplated under that article, for the only right with respect to which the Prov ince of Bengal could be said to have been a party to the pending proceeding on the facts of this case was the right to tax the agricultural income of the plaintiff under the provisions of the Bengal Agricultural Income tax Act, 1944, and that right was not derived by the Province of East Bengal by transfer under the Rights, Property and Liabili ties Order.\\r\\nAs rightly pointed out by the High Court, the right of taxation under the Bengal Act of 1944 passed to the Province of East Bengal as part of the Sovereign Dominion of Pakistan by virtue of the provisions of section 18(3) of the Indian Independence Act, 1947, which provided that \"the law of British India and of the several parts thereof immediate ly before the appointed day shall, so far as applicable and with the necessary adaptations, continue as the law of each of the new Dominions and the several parts thereof, until other provision is made by the laws of the legislature of the Dominion in question or by any other legislature or other authority having power in that behalf.\\r\\n\" The question next arises whether there was a transfer of any \"liability\" by the Order as contemplated in article 12(2).\\r\\nMr. Sen Gupta relied in this connection on article 10 (2) (a) which provides that \"where immediately before the appointed day the Province of Bengal is subject to any such liability (i.e., \"any liability in respect of an actionable wrong other than breach of contract\") referred to in sub section (1)that liability shall, where the cause of action arose wholly within the territories which, as from that day, are the territories of the Province of East Bengal, be a liability of that Province.\\r\\n\" It was contended that the Province 11 of Bengal was, according to the plaintiff \\'s case, liable to be restrained from proceeding with the illegal and unautho rised assessment on the basis of the notice issued under the Bengal Act of 1944, and that liability, in respect of which the cause of action arose wholly in Dacca (where the as sessment proceeding had been initiated) within the territo ries of the Province of East Bengal, became a liability of that Province.\\r\\nThe High Court rejected this contention on the ground \"that article 10(2) is concerned with the liabil ity for an actionable wrong other than breach of contract and it is impossible to say that by serving a notice on the plaintiff under the Bengal Agricultural Income tax Act through one of its officers the Province of Bengal had committed an actionable wrong \\'.\\r\\nAssuming that it exceeded its power or acted under an invalid provision of law, the plaintiff may have a declaration to that effect but the Act complained of cannot be said to have been a tortious act.\\r\\nBut even assuming that it was, it is to be remembered that the issue of the notice was an exercise of powers conferred by the Act in relation to the sovereign rights of the Crown and it is elementary that the Crown or the State is not answerable for even negligent or tortious acts of its offi cers done in the course of their official duties imposed by a statute, except where the particular act was specifically directed and the Crown profited by performance . .\\r\\nNo liability for an actionable wrong is thus involved in the suit and Dr. Sen Gupta cannot establish a right to proceed against the Province of East Bengal on the basis that the liability was transferred to that Province under article 10(2) of the Order.\\r\\n\" We are unable to share \\'this view.\\r\\nThe learned Judges have placed much too narrow a construction on the phrase \"liability in respect of an actionable wrong\".\\r\\nThey have assumed that the phrase connotes only a liability for dam ages for a completed, tortious act and that the initiation of what according to the plaintiff was an unauthorised and illegal assessment proceeding by purporting to serve a notice requiring the plaintiff to submit a return of his total agricultural income under section 24 (2) of the Bengal Agricultural 12 Income tax Act, 1944, through an appropriate officer func tioning under that Act, the Province of Bengal had not committed an \"actionable wrong\".\\r\\nThis, in our opinion, is not a correct view of the matter.\\r\\nUnder section 9(1) (b) of the Indian Independence Act, 1947, the Governor General of British India was directed to make provision by order \"for dividing between the new Dominions and between the new Provinces to be constituted under this Act, the powers, rights, property, duties and liabilities of the Governor General in Council or as the case may be of the relevant Provinces which under this Act are to cease to exist\", and the Indian Independence (Rights, Property and Liabilities) Order is the only Order by which such provision was made.\\r\\nThe intention being thus to provide for the initial distri bution of rights, property and liabilities as between the two Dominions and their Provinces, a wide and liberal con struction, as far as the language used would admit, should be placed upon the terms of the Order, so as to leave no gap or lacuna in relation to the matters sought to be provided for.\\r\\nThere is no reason, accordingly, why the words \"li ability in respect of an actionable wrong\" should be under stood in the restricted sense of liability for damages for completed tortious acts.\\r\\nWe consider that the words are apt to cover the liability to be restrained by injunction from completing what on the plaintiff \\'s case was an illegal or unauthorised act already commenced.\\r\\nThe service of the notice on the plaintiff under section 24(2) of the Bengal Act amounts to much more than a mere threat in the abstract to impose an illegal levy.\\r\\nIt is the actual initiation of an illegal assessment proceeding which, in the normal course, will \\'in all probability culminate in an illegal levy of tax.\\r\\nThe failure to make a return as required by the notice would result under section 25(5) of the Act in the Income tax Officer making an ex parte assessment to the best of his judgment and determining the sum payable by the assessee on the basis of such assessment.\\r\\nSuch failure would also expose the plaintiff under section 32(1) of the Act to the impo sition of a penalty which may equal the amount of the tax assessed on him or to a prosecution as for an offence 13 before a Magistrate under section 53 (1), at the option of the Income tax authority.\\r\\nIt is thus plain that the service of a notice requiring a return of income to be furnished for assessment under the Act is a step fraught with serious consequences to the assessee, and if the assessment proposed was illegal and unauthorised by reason of the Act itself being ultra vires in so far as it purported to make the Rulers of Indian States liable to taxation thereunder as contended for by the plaintiff, the service of such notice marked the commencement of a wrongful act against the plain tiff by the Bengal Government under colour of the Act and there can be no doubt that such a wrongful act is actionable in the sense that an action would lie in a civil court for an injunction restraining its completion.\\r\\nThat was the liability to which the Province of Bengal was subject ac cording to the plaintiff \\'s case at the time when he insti tuted the suit, and that liability, in our opinion, passed to the Province of East Bengal by virtue of article 10 (9.) (a) of the Indian Independence (Rights, Property and Liabil ities) Order, 1947.\\r\\nThere is no question here of the li ability of the Crown for damages for the negligent or tor tious act of its officers.\\r\\nOn the allegations in the plaint, which must, for the purpose of deciding the question of jurisdiction as a preliminary issue, be assumed to be well founded, the Province of Bengal was undoubtedly liable to be sued for an injunction restraining it from proceeding with the assessment and none the less so because the notice was served in purported exercise of powers conferred by the Bengal Act.\\r\\nThe name of the Income tax Officer originally impleaded as the second defendant having been struck off the record, no question in regard to his liability arises.\\r\\nReference was made to certain text books where a \"tort\" is spoken of as an \"actionable wrong\" and it was suggested that the two expressions are synonymous.\\r\\nEvery tort is undoubtedly an actionable wrong but the converse does not necessarily follow.\\r\\nIndeed, the words \"other than breach of contract\" used in article 10 (1) make it plain that the expression \"actionable wrong\" is used in a wider sense 14 which would have included breach of contract but for those limiting words.\\r\\nIt was said that even assuming that the service of the notice calling for a return of income was a wrongful act, it was not \"actionable\", as section 65 of the Bengal Act barred suits in civil courts \"to set aside or modify any assessment made under this Act\".\\r\\nThe short answer to this contention is that the suit in question is not a suit \"to set aside or modify an assessment\" made under the Act, as no assessment had yet been made when it was instituted, and the subsequent completion of the assessment was made by the Pakistan In come tax authorities on terms agreed to between the parties and sanctioned by the Court.\\r\\nThe decision of the Privy Council in Raleigh Investment Co. Ltd. vs Governor General in Council (1) relied on in support of the contention is distinguishable, as the main relief claimed there was repay ment of the tax alleged to have been wrongfully levied under colour of an ultra vires provision in the Indian Income tax Act.\\r\\nTheir Lordships observed: \"In form the relief claimed does not profess to modify or set aside the assessment.\\r\\nIn substance it does, for repayment of part of the sum due by virtue of the notice of demand could not be ordered so long as the assessment stood.\\r\\nFurther, the claim for the declaration cannot be rationally regarded as having any relevance except as leading up to the claim for repayment, and the claim for an injunction is merely verbiage.\\r\\nThe cloud of words fails to obscure the point of the suit.\\r\\n\" The position here is entirely different.\\r\\nThe gist of the wrongful act complained of in the present case is sub jecting the plaintiff to the harassment and trouble by commencing against him an illegal and unauthorised assess ment proceeding which may eventually result in an unlawful imposition and levy of tax.\\r\\nIt was suggested, somewhat faintly, that the cause of action for the suit, though stated in the plaint to have arisen in Dacca, now in the Province of East (1) 15 Bengal, did not arise wholly within the territories of the Province of East Bengal within the meaning of Article 10 (2) (a) inasmuch as the notice calling for a return, though issued from Dacca, was received by the Manager of the Estate at Agartalla in Tripura State.\\r\\nAssuming that the contention has any substance it is of no assistance to the respondent, for article 10 (2) (c) would then be applicable to the case and the Province of East Bengal would still be liable, though jointly with the Province of West Bengal.\\r\\nWe are therefore of opinion that the Province of East Bengal having succeeded to the liability to which the Province of Bengal was subject immediately before the ap pointed day, the former Province is to be deemed to be substituted for the other Province as a party to the suit and the suit must accordingly continue in the Court of the Subordinate Judge at Alipore, which has jurisdiction to proceed with it under article 4 of the Indian Independence (Legal Proceedings) Order, 1947.\\r\\nIn this view it is unnecessary to consider the question of submission to jurisdiction urged in the alternative by the appellant.\\r\\nIn the result the appeal is allowed, the order of the Court below is set aside and the suit now pending in the Court of the Subordinate Judge at Alipore will be heard and determined by it.\\r\\nThe respondent will pay the appellant \\'s costs throughout.\\r\\nFAZL ALI J.\\r\\nThe question to be decided in this appeal is whether the Subordinate Judge \\'s Court at Alipore in the State of West Bengal, has jurisdiction to try a suit in which the Province of East Bengal was impleaded as a defend ant, after the 15th August,1947 In what circumstances this question has arisen will appear from the facts of the case which may be briefly stated.\\r\\nIn 1944, the Bengal Legislature passed an Act called the Bengal Agricultural Income tax Act, 1944 (Bengal Act IV of 1944), which enabled it to impose a tax on the agricul tural income of various classes 16 of persons including \"every Ruler of an Indian State,\" holding lands within the territory of Bengal.\\r\\nThe appel lant, who is the Ruler of the State of Tripura, holds a zamindary called Chakla Roshanabad Estates, which was situ ated in the Province of Bengal and in the District of Sylhet formerly appertaining to the Province of Assam.\\r\\nOn the 28th February, 1945, the Agricultural Income tax Officer, Dacca Range, issued a notice under section 24 (2) of the Bengal Act to the Manager of the Chakla Roshanabad Estates calling upon him to furnish a return of the appellant \\'s total agri cultural income for the previous year, derived from lands situated within the Province of Bengal.\\r\\nOn the 12th June, 1945, the appellant instituted a suit in the Court of the Subordinate Judge at Dacca, against the Province of Bengal and the Agricultural Income tax Officer, Dacca Range, claim ing the following reliefs: (1) For a declaration that the Bengal Agricultural Income tax Act, 1944, so far as it imposes a liability to pay agricultural income tax on the plaintiff is ultra vires and void and that the plaintiff \\' is not bound by the same.\\r\\n(2) For a declaration that in any case the notice served by the Agricultural Income tax Officer, Dacca Range, above referred to, is void and of no effect and that no assessment can be made on the basis of that notice.\\r\\n(3) For a perpetual injunction to restrain the defend ants from taking any steps to assess the plaintiff to agricultural income tax.\\r\\nOn the 15th July, 1945, the suit was transferred to the Court of the Subordinate Judge at Alipore in the District of 24 Parganas, by an Order of the Calcutta High Court.\\r\\nWhile the suit was still pending, the new Province of East Bengal, which forms part of the territories of the Dominion of Pakistan, came into existence on the 15th August, 1947, as a result of the Indian Independence Act, 1947, and it appears that the whole of Chakla Roshanabad Estates falls within that Province.\\r\\nAfter the creation of the new Province, 17 a petition was filed on the 9th December, 1947, on behalf of the Province of East Bengal, drawing the attention of the Court at Alipore to the fact that the Province of West Bengal, which forms part of the territories of the Dominion of India, was taking no interest in the suit and asking the Court to accept a written statement which was also filed along with the petition, and in which the only plea taken was that the Alipore Court had no jurisdiction to hear the suit or make any order of injunction against the Province of East Bengal or defendant No. 2.\\r\\nThe last paragraph of the written statement was to the following effect: \"The Province of East Bengal appears only to contest the jurisdiction of the court and it submits that the suit should be dismissed on that ground.\\r\\n\" Later on, the Province of East Bengal was irapleaded as a defendant in the suit and the name of the Income tax Officer of Dacca was removed from the category of defend ants.\\r\\nThe Subordinate Judge then proceeded to try the question of jurisdiction as a preliminary issue, and decided that by virtue of the provisions of the Indian Independence (Legal Proceedings) Order, 1947, read with section 9 of the Indian Independence Act, 1947, the Court had jurisdiction to try the suit against the new Province.\\r\\nThereupon, the respondent (the Province of East Bengal) moved the High Court at Calcutta under section 115 of the Code of Civil Procedure, against the order of the Subordinate Judge, and a Bench of the High Court consisting of Harries C.J. and Chakravarthi J. allowed the application and set aside the order of the Subordinate Judge, giving effect to the objec tion of the respondent that the Court at Alipore was not competent to try the suit against the Province of East Bengal.\\r\\nOne of the points raised on behalf of the appellant before the High Court was that the Province of East Bengal had submitted to the jurisdiction \\' of the Subordinate Judge \\'s Court, but this point was negatived.\\r\\nThe appellant was thereafter granted a certificate under section 205 (1) of the Government of India Act, 1935, and on the basis of it he has preferred this appeal.\\r\\n18 On a reference to the judgments of the learned Subordi nate Judge and the High Court, it appears that three provi sions were relied upon by the appellant in support of his contention that the Court at Alipore had jurisdiction to try the suit, these being section 9 of the Indian Independ ence Act, 1947, article 4 of the Indian Independence (Legal Proceedings) Order, 1947, [hereinafter referred to as \\'the Legal Proceedings Order \\'], and section 12 of the Indian Independence (Rights, Property and Liabilities) Order, 1947, Therein after referred to as \\' the Rights, etc., Order \\'].\\r\\nThese provisions run as follows : Section 9 of the Indian Independence Act : \"The Governor General shall by order make such provi sion as appears to him to be necessary or expedient (a) for bringing the provisions of this Act into effective operation; (b) for dividing between the new Dominions, and be tween the new Provinces, to be constituted under this Act, the powers, rights, property, duties and liabilities of the Governor General in Council or, as the case may be, of the relevant Provinces which, under this Act, are to cease to exist . . \" Section 4 of the Legal Proceedings Order : \"Notwithstanding the creation of certain new Provinces and the transfer of certain territories from the Province of Assam to the Province of East Bengal by the Indian Independ ence Act, 1947, (1) all proceedings pending immediately before the appointed day in any civil or criminal court (other than a High Court) in the Province of Bengal, the Punjab or Assam shall be continued in that court as if the said Act had not been passed, and that court shall continue to have for the purposes of the said proceedings all the jurisdiction and powers which it had immediately before the appointed day; (2) any appeal or application for revision in respect of any proceedings so pending in any such 19 court shall lie in the court which would have appellate, or as the case may be revisional, jurisdiction over that court if the proceedings were instituted in that court after the appointed day; and (3) effect shall be given within the territories either of the two Dominions to any judgment, decree, order, or sentence of any such court in the said proceedings, as if it had been passed by a court of competent jurisdiction within that Dominion.\\r\\n\" Section 12 of the Rights, etc.\\r\\nOrder : \"(1) Where immediately before the appointed day, the Governor General in Council is a party to any legal proceed ings with respect to any property, rights or liabilities transferred by this Order, the Dominion which succeeds to the property, rights or liabilities in accordance with the provisions of this Order shall be deemed to be substituted for the Governor General in Council as a party to the pro ceedings, and the proceedings may continue accordingly.\\r\\n(2) Where any Province from which property, rights or liabilities are transferred by this Order is, immediately before the transfer, a party to legal proceedings with respect to that property or those rights or liabilities, the Province which succeeds to the property, rights or liabili ties of this Order shall be deemed to be substituted for the other Province as a party to those proceedings, and the proceedings may continue accordingly.\\r\\n(3) Any proceedings which, immediately before the ap pointed day, are pending by or against the Secretary of State elsewhere than in the United King dom in respect of any liability of the Governor General in Council or a Prov ince shall, * * * * (b) in the case of proceedings in respect, of the Prov ince of Bengal, the Province of the Punjab, or the Province of Assam, be continued by or against the Province which suc ceeds to the liability . . \" The learned Subordinate Judge based his judgment entire ly upon section 4 of the Legal Proceedings 20 Order, but the High Court has pointed out that that Order standing by itself can be of no help to the appellant.\\r\\nAccording to the High Court, that section might have enabled the appellant to prosecute his suit against the Province of Bengal, but it could not enable \\'him to continue the suit against the new Province without invoking section 12 (2) of the Rights, etc.\\r\\nOrder, which provides among other things that the Province which succeeds to the rights or liabilities of the old Province of Bengal by virtue of that Order shall be deemed to be substituted for the latter as a party to the pending proceedings.\\r\\nIn my opinion, this is the correct view.\\r\\nIt Was urged before us that a Court which had juris diction to try a suit against a party would, by reason of what is provided in section 4 of the Legal Proceedings Order, naturally have jurisdiction to substitute the heir or legal representative of that party.\\r\\nGenerally speaking, this must be so, but, in the present case, the Province of East Bengal which forms part of another sovereign State could not be automatically substituted for the Province of Bengal, unless the substitution was permitted by some provision of the Indian Independence Act or any of the Orders issued thereun der.\\r\\nThe whole case thus rests on the proper construction of section 12(2) of the Rights, etc.\\r\\nOrder.\\r\\nIn the High Court, it was strenuously urged on behalf of the appellant that section 12(2) is fully applicable to the present case on account of certain rights having been transferred to the Province of East Bengal from the old Province of Bengal.\\r\\nThis argument was reiterated in this Court also, but it is obviously untenable, for the reasons set out in the judgment of the High Court.\\r\\nAs has been pointed out by the High Court, section 12 (2) is of no help to the appellant, unless the rights in question were transferred by the Rights, etc.\\r\\nOrder itself.\\r\\nThe learned counsel for the appellant however failed to point out any provision of this Order, by which any of the rights referred to by him had been transferred.\\r\\nHe had therefore to fall back upon an alternative argu ment based on section 10(2) of the same Order; and the point to be decided by this Court has thus 21 crystallized into one simple issue, namely, whether section 10(2) of the Order can be of any avail to the appellant.\\r\\nSection 10 (2) must be read with section 10 (1), and the material part of these two sub sections runs as follows : \"10 (1) Where immediately before the appointed day the Governor General in Council is subject to any liability in respect of an actionable wrong other than breach of con tract, that liability shall, (a) where the cause of action arose wholly within the territories which, as from that day, are the territories of the Dominion of India, be a liability of that Dominion;. (2) Where immediately before the appointed day the Province of Bengal is subject to any such liability as aforesaid, that liability shall, (a) where the cause of action arose wholly within the territories which, as from that day, are the territories of the Province of East Bengal, be a liability of that Prov ince; (b) where the cause of action arose wholly within the territories which, as from that day, are the territories of the Province of West Bengal, be a liability of that Prov ince; and (c) in any other case, be a joint liability of the Provinces of East and West Bengal.\" * * * * It is quite clear that for the application of section 10(2), it is necessary to show inter alia that the Province of Bengal was subject to a liability in respect of an ac tionable wrong other than a breach of contract.\\r\\nA reference to any book on tort will show that the words used in sub section\\r\\n(1) are commonly used to define a tort.\\r\\nA tort has been defined in Stroud \\'s Judicial Dictionary, Second Edition, page 2072, as a wrong independent of contract, and it is also so described in the Common Law Procedure Act, 1852 (15 & 16 Vict., c. 76); in Halsbury \\'s Laws of England and in many textbooks.\\r\\nThe difference between \"a wrong independent of contract\" and \"a wrong other than a 22 breach of contract\" is merely verbal and has little signifi cance.\\r\\nA tort is also often referred to as \"an actionable wrong\" and the two expressions have been synonymously used by eminent writers including Sir Fredrick Pollock and Pro fessor Burdick of America, who has designated his well known book on the law of torts as \"a concise treatise on civil liability for actionable wrongs to person and property\".\\r\\nWhether the expression can be taken to be a complete defini tion of a tort may be questioned, because as Addison has pointed out in his book on torts, \"to say that a tort is an actionable wrong leaves undefined the term \\'actionable wrong \\'.\\r\\n\" But there can be no doubt that in legal parlance, the two expressions are assumed to be interchangeable.\\r\\nThere is also another matter to be borne in mind in construing section 10 (2) of the Rights, etc.\\r\\nOrder, and that is the well recognized fact that the primary and most common remedy for a tort is an action for damages.\\r\\nThat this is an important feature of a tort is shown by the fact that in many textbooks an action for damages has been made an inte gral part of the definition of a tort.\\r\\nA few examples will make this clear.\\r\\nA tort is defined by Salmond as \"a civil wrong for which the remedy is a common law action for unliq uidated damages and which is not exclusively the breach of a contract or the breach of a trust or other merely equitable obligation.\" Professor Winfield, who did not see eye to eye with Salmond on many matters connected with the law of torts, gives the following definition of tortious liability : \" Tortious liability arises from the breach of a duty primarily fixed by the law; this duty is towards persons generally and its breach is redressible by an action for unliquidated damages.\\r\\n\" In Underhill \\'s law of torts, the definition runs as follows : \"A tort is an act or omission which is unauthorized by law and independently of contract infringes (i) some absolute right of another, etc., and (ii) gives rise to an action for damages at the suit of the injured party.\\r\\n\" The learned author after attempting to define a tort in this way goes on to state: \"A tort is described in the Common 23 Law Procedure Act, 1852, as a wrong independent of contract.\\r\\nIf we use the word \\'wrong \\' as equivalent to violation of a right recognized and enforced by law by means of an action for damages, the definition is sufficiently accurate, but scarcely very lucid;for it gives no clue to what constitutes a wrong or violation of a right recognized and enforced by law.\\r\\nIt does, however, emphasize the fact that an essential characteristic of a tort is that the appropriate remedy for it is an action for damages.\\r\\nAn act or omission which does not give rise to an action for damages is not a tort.\\r\\n\" It must be recognized that an injunction may also be an appropriate remedy in a limited number of cases, but it is not a remedy of universal application, and no one has yet suggested that it may be treated as an incident of tort.\\r\\nIn the light of the foregoing discussion, it seems to me to be permissible to infer, firstly, that section 10 of the Rights, etc.\\r\\nOrder refers to liability for a tort, and secondly, that what is contemplated there is pecuniary liability such as liability to damages.\\r\\nThe word \"liabili ty\" has a wider meaning and also a narrower meaning, and the latter would appear to be the appropriate meaning where the word is used in contrast to assets or something which corre sponds to or is in the nature of assets, and where it is used in plural or is preceded by an indefinite article, e.g., when the expression \"a liability\" is used.\\r\\nWe must remember that the purpose of the Rights, etc.\\r\\nOrder was, among other things, to divide or distribute the rights, property and liabilities of the undivided Province of Bengal between the two new Provinces.\\r\\nTherefore, the view that the liabilities referred to in section 10 are liabilities capable of being ascertained in terms of money and not liabilities in any abstract or academic sense, is in conso nance with the purpose of the Order as well as the well known fact that for a tort the most common and appropriate remedy is an action for pecuniary damages.\\r\\nThis view is further confirmed by reading section 13 (2) of the Rights, etc.\\r\\nOrder, which runs thus : 24 \"Where by virtue of the preceding provisions of this Order either of the Dominions or any Province becomes sub ject to any liability, and it is just and equitable that a contribution towards that liability should be made by the other Dominion, or by another Province, as the case may be, the other Dominion shall make to the Dominion or Province primarily subject to the liability such contribution in respect thereof as, in default of an agreement, may be determined by the Arbitral Tribunal.\\r\\n\" It should be noted that the words \"becomes subject to any liability\" used in the above provision are practically the words which occur in section 10 of the same Order, and the language of section 13 (2) clearly shows that the word \"liabili ty\" must have been used in the narrower sense of pecuniary liability, because otherwise no question of contribution towards that liability by the Dominion or Province would arise.\\r\\nIt will be also instructive to refer to Part VII, Chapter III of the Government of India Act, 1935, the head ing of which is \"Property, Contracts, Liabilities, and Suits,\" and upon which the Rights, etc.\\r\\nOrder appears tohave been modeled.\\r\\nIn section 179 of the Government of India Act, 1935, which occurs in this Chapter, the clue to the meaning of the word \\' liability. \\' is furnished by the provision that \"any sum ordered to be paid by way of debt, damages or costs in any such proceedings, and any costs or expenses . . shall be paid out of the revenues of the Federation or the Province, as the case may be . . \"I think that it will be quite a fair construction to hold that what is contemplated in section 10 of the Rights, etc.\\r\\nOrder is that the liability referred to therein would be met out of the revenues of the Province concerned.\\r\\nThe construction I have suggested appears to me to represent what the framers of the Order must have intended to convey by the words \"liability in respect of an action able wrong\", but, lest it should be said that it is too narrow a construction, I shall deal with the matter more fully giving to the words \"actionable wrong\" and \"liability\" as wide a meaning as they can 25 bear in a legal context.\\r\\nProceeding on this footing, the first question to be asked is: What is a wrong other than a breach of contract ? In answering this question, it is neither possible nor helpful to ignore all that has been said in authoritative textbooks and judgments in dealing with the question of a tort, because the foundation of every tort is a wrong or a wrongful act.\\r\\nIt is true that at one time some of the writers were inclined to think that \"there was no English law of tort but there was merely an English law of torts, that is, a list of acts and omissions which under certain conditions were actionable.\" But, now, the view has considerably broadened, and, generally speaking, it is acknowledged that \\' \\'torts are infinitely various not limited or confined\" (see Chapman vs pickersgill), and that wherever there is an injury by the invasion of a right, a wrong or a tort is committed.\\r\\nThis is often conveyed by the expression injuria sine damnum.\\r\\nThe word \"wrong\" has been used in sections 17, 18 and 19 of the Code of Civil Proce dure, and the following extract from Mulla \\'s commentary thereon will show how this word has been construed: \"Wrong means a tort or actionable wrong, i.e., an act which is legally wrongful as prejudicially affecting a legal right of the plaintiff.\\r\\n\" Underhill also construes \"wrong\" in the same sense, because a wrong is, according to him, equivalent to viola tion of a right recognised and enforced by law by means of an action for damages.\\r\\nI think therefore that in view of all that has been written and said on the subject, it may be safely stated that a wrong must consist of the following elements : (1) There must be an act or omission amounting to an infringement of a legal right of a person or a breach of legal duty towards him; and (2) The act or omission must have caused harm or damage to that person in some way, the damage being either actual or presumed.\\r\\nThese two elements are denoted by two Latin expressions, injuria and damnum.\\r\\nI have to include (1) [1762] 2 Wils.\\r\\n146, per Pratt C.J. 4 26 presumed damage under the second head, because in certain cases such as trespass, assault, false imprisonment, etc.\\r\\nthe invasion of a right may be so flagrant that \"the law conclusively presumes damage.\" (See observations of Lord Wright M.R. in Nicholls vs Ely Beet Sugar Factory(1 ).\\r\\nSuch cases are often described as cases of absolute liability or cases where a tort is actionable per se without proof of damage.\\r\\nLet us then see whether the two elements of an action able wrong are present in this case.\\r\\nFor this purpose, we must examine the best and most plausible statement of the appellant \\'s case which may be put more or less in the fol lowing way : The issue of a notice, which has been referred to in paragraph S of the plaint calling upon the appellant to furnish a return of his total agricultural income derived from lands situated within the Province of Bengal, was the first step in the initiation of an illegal assessment pro ceeding which was likely to lead to an illegal levy of tax, and the commencement of an illegal proceeding in this manner gave a right of action to the appellant and entitled him to claim an injunction restraining the defendants from complet ing the proceeding.\\r\\nSuch being the position, the case is covered by section 10 of the Order under consideration, the words used there being wide enough to cover liability to be restrained by an injunction from completing an illegal or unauthorized act already commenced.\\r\\nConsequently, the li ability to be so restrained must be deemed to have been transferred to the Province of East Bengal, by virtue of section 10 of the Rights, etc.\\r\\nOrder.\\r\\nThis may appear to be a plausible way of putting the case, but, when we subject it to a close scrutiny, we find that even on the above statement the true requirements of the material provision are not satisfied.\\r\\nIf we confine ourselves to something which has happened, as opposed to something which may happen in future, that is to say, if we look for an act or omission which must be the foundation of every wrong, we find that all that is said to have happened in this (1) 27 case is the issuing of a notice, which is not some unautho rised or prima facie unlawful act but is an act done trader the authority of a statute and enjoined by it.\\r\\nIt has to be borne in mind that the attack in the plaint is not against the whole Act but all that is contended is that only a par ticular provision of it is ultra vires.\\r\\nThe contention comes to this, that the issuing of a notice against every person other than the Ruler of an Indian State would have been a perfectly legitimate act, but the issuing of a notice against a Ruler is ultra vires.\\r\\nBut that is not enough to constitute a wrong.\\r\\nWhat has to be shown is that the issu ing of the notice is a wrongful act, i.e., it amounts to an infringement of some right.\\r\\nWhat known right of person or property or any other description it infringes is not at all clear; nor has that been stated in the pleadings.\\r\\nIt is conceded that there has been no assessment and no realiza tion of any tax and it could not also be disputed that it was open to the appellant to show to the assessing authority that he was not assessable at all.\\r\\nTo say that a notice is the first step , in the initiation of an illegal assessment proceeding, does not carry the matter further, but it would seem to be merely a piece of verbiage used to obscure the fundamental weakness of the appellant \\'s case.\\r\\nConstruing \"wrong\" as it should be construed, the essential thing to find out is in what way a right has been infringed or there has been a breach of duty.\\r\\nIt is the appellant \\'s own case that the suit is for a threatened or apprehended wrong, but that very expression shows that the suit has been brought before the alleged wrong was committed.\\r\\nThe other element of a wrong, namely, that the person should have sustained some harm or injury, is also wanting in this case.\\r\\nIt is not the case of the appellant that the notice has in any way caused any actual damage to him.\\r\\nNor is it suggested that this is one of those cases in which damage should be presumed.\\r\\nAll that is said is that the notice was likely to entail trouble and harassment to the appellant, but that by itself will not constitute a wrong.\\r\\n28 The matter may be tested in another way.\\r\\nAs Underhill points out,\" an act or omission which does not give rise to an action for damages is not a tort.\\r\\n\" To the same effect is the following observation in Salmond \\'s Law of Torts: \" No civil injury is to be classed as a tort unless the appropriate remedy for it is an action for damages.\\r\\nSuch an action is an essential characteristic of every true tort.\\r\\n\" Again, Professor Winfield says that an action for unliqui dated damages is the one sure test of tortious liability and has cited cases where this statement has received judicial approval.\\r\\nI think these statements will be equally true if we drop the word \"tort\" and substitute the words\" actionable wrong\" in its place.\\r\\nIt follows that one of the tests of an actionable wrong is that while other remedies also may be open to the plaintiff, an action for damages is the primary remedy for it.\\r\\nCan the appellant in this case maintain a suit for damages on the allegations made by him in his plaint? As I have already stated, a reference to the plaint shows that no damages has been either alleged or claimed and it has also not been stated that the appellant is entitled to any damage.\\r\\nIn Rogers vs Rajendro Dutt(1)the Privy Council stated that \"it is essential to an action in tort that the act complained of should be legally wrongful as regards the party complaining; that is, it must prejudi cially affect him in some legal right.\\r\\n\" Again, it was ob served in Kali Kischen Tagoor vs Jodoo Lal Mullick(2) that\"there may be, where a right is interfered within ju ria sine damno sufficient to found an action; but no action can be maintained if there is neither damnum nor injuria.\\r\\n\" It seems to me therefore that in the absence of the two elements to which I have referred, no case for liability in respect of an actionable wrong has been made out, and it is wholly inappropriate to invoke section 10 of the Rights, etc.\\r\\nOrder in the present case.\\r\\nIt appears that the whole of the appellant \\'s arguments has been woven round the following two matters : (1) 8 Moore \\'s I.A. 103 at p. 135.\\r\\n(2) 6 I.A. 190.\\r\\n29 (1) Injunction is a recognized form of action; and (2) Injunction has been asked for in the present Case, in connection with something which is said to be likely to culminate in a wrong.\\r\\nThe situation as envisaged is however very different from what is contemplated in section 10 of the Rights, etc.\\r\\nOrder, which is liability for an actionable wrong and not liability for something which may become a wrong in future.\\r\\nIt is to be remembered that there are two words used in the section, viz., actionable and wrong.\\r\\nThe mere fact that a matter is actionable will not bring the case within the four corners of \\' section 10 of the Order, unless all the elements of a wrong are established.\\r\\nI think it will be appropriate at this stage to say a few words about the remedy by way of an injunction in cases where an actionable wrong is said to have been committed.\\r\\nIt cannot be disputed that injunction is one of the remedies in certain cases of torts.\\r\\nAs Addison has pointed out, \"the origin of \\' the remedy by way of an injunction is to be found in the inadequacy of the legal remedy by way of damages in many of the more serious wrongs, such as continuing tres passes and nuisances, where a wrongful act has been done and there was an intention to continue doing it.\\r\\n(See Addison \\'s Law of Torts, 8th Edn. 111).\\r\\nInjunction will also be granted to prevent a threatened injury or wrong, if it can be shown that the threatened act if carried into execution will lead to violation of a right and such will be the inevitable result.\\r\\nAs was pointed out in an English case, the interfer ence of the court in these cases is rounded on its jurisdic tion to give relief in the shape of preventive justice in order to protect properties and rights from that which, if completed, would give a right of action.\\r\\nThese two cases in which an injunction may be issued stand on two different footings, and the liability to an injunction does.\\r\\nnot necessarily and always amount to \"liability in respect of an actionable wrong\".\\r\\nThe two liabilities may possibly coin cide where there is a continuing wrong and the injunction is intended to stop its 30 continuance.\\r\\nBut, as I have already stated, where no wrong has been committed, it would require considerable straining of the meaning of familiar legal expressions to say that \"liability in respect of an actionable wrong\" is identical with \"liability to an injunction in respect of an apprehend ed wrong\".\\r\\n\"Liability in respect of an actionable wrong\" means liability when an actionable wrong has been committed.\\r\\nIt cannot mean liability to be prevented from a wrong which is apprehended.\\r\\nNor can the liability which is contemplated in section 10 of the Rights, etc.\\r\\nOrder be created by the mere filing of a suit in which an injunction is claimed.\\r\\nI should like to refer here to section 176 (1) of the Government of India Act, 1935, which provides as follows : \"The Federation may sue or be sued by the name of the Federation of India and a Provincial Government may sue or be sued by the name of the Province, and, without prejudice to the subsequent provisions of this chapter, may, subject to any provisions which may be made by Act of the Federal Legislature or a Provincial Legislature enacted by virtue of powers conferred on the Legislature by this Act, sue or be sued in relation to their respective affairs in like cases as the Secretary of State in Council might have sued or been sued if this Act had not been passed.\\r\\n\" This section is divisible into two parts.\\r\\nThe first part states as to which authority should be named as a plaintiff or as a defendant in a suit brought by or against the Crown or the Government, and the second part deals with cases in which the Federal or the Provincial Government may sue or be sued.\\r\\nTo understand the latter provision, the section is to be read with section 65 of the Government of India Act, 1858, and section 32 of the Government of India Act, 1915.\\r\\nSection 65 of the Act of 1858 enacted that \"the Secretary of State in Council shall and may sue and be sued as well in India as in England by the name of the Secretary of State in Council as a body corporate; and all persons and bodies politic shall and 31 may have and take the same suits, remedies and proceedings, legal and equitable, against the Secretary of State in Council of India as they could have done against the said Company.\" (East India Co.).\\r\\nThe same provision is substantially made in section 32 of the Act of 1915.\\r\\nSuch being the law, the question has been posed in a number of cases from very early days as to whether, and, if so, in what cases, the Secretary of State would be liable for a wrong or a tort committed by the servants of the Crown, and it has now been definitely held that he may be liable in certain cases.\\r\\nSo far as the present discussion is concerned, the following three points which emerge from a careful perusal of a large number of cases bearing on the subject, seem to be material : (1) The principles of the law of torts have been con sistently applied in all cases dealing with the liability of the Secretary of State for wrongs committed by the serv ants or agents of the crown or the Government.\\r\\n(2) It is settled law that the Secretary of State cannot be held liable for wrongs committed by the servants of the Crown in the performance of duties imposed by the Legisla ture: [See Shivabhajan vs Secretary of State for India(1).\\r\\nJames Evans vs Secretary of State(2).\\r\\nTobin vs Reg(3).\\r\\nRoss vs Secretary of State(4), in which this principle is fully explained and the reasons upon which it is based, are clear ly set out].\\r\\n(3) It is also well settled that where a statute spe cially authorizes a certain act to be done by a certain person, which would otherwise be unlawful or actionable, no action will lie for the doing of the act.\\r\\nOn these principles, it would appear that neither the Agricultural Income tax Officer, who has now been dismissed out of action, nor the Province of East Bengal, could be said to be subject to a liability in respect of an action able wrong, assuming that an actionable wrong has been committed.\\r\\nIt must (1) I.L.R. (3) ; (2) A.I.R. 1920 Lah. 364.\\r\\n(4) I.L.R. 32 however be stated that this conclusion rests on the.\\r\\nas sumption that my construction of an actionable wrong is correct.\\r\\nIt was contended that in deciding the present appeal, we must assume all the facts stated in the plaint to be correct and therefore assume that the Bengal Act is ultra vires and the notice issued was without authority.\\r\\nI have already pointed out that the whole Act is not attacked, but only one single provision thereof is said to be ultra vires, and I shall show later, when I deal with section 65 of the Bengal Act, that even the assumption we are asked to make will not bring the case within section 10 of the Rights, etc.\\r\\nOrder.\\r\\nMr. Setalvad, the learned Attorney General of India, who intervened on behalf of the Union of India in the ap peal, supported the judgment of the High Court on three main grounds, which may be summed up as follows : (1) that the words used in section 10 of the Rights, etc.\\r\\nOrder do not cover this case, because here no wrong has been actually committed and a threatened wrong is different from an actual wrong; (2) that section 65 of the Bengal Agricultural Income tax Act is a bar to the suit; and (3) that the present suit must in any event end in an infructuous decree and should not be allowed to be pursued.\\r\\nI have already dealt with the first point, and wish simply to add that the point which is now pressed is not specifically raised in the Memorandum of Appeal presented in this Court, nor is there any trace of it in the Statement of Case filed by the appellant.\\r\\nThe point which is mentioned in the Memorandum of Appeal and the Statement of Case is that section 12 of the Rights, etc.\\r\\nOrder is applicable to the present case, because certain rights have been trans ferred from the old Province of Bengal to the Province of East Bengal.\\r\\nThere is however no mention of section 10 of the Order, nor is it stated that liability to an injunction brings the case within that 33 section.\\r\\nThus, a notable feature of the case is that almost every argument which was advanced in the courts below is to be discarded, and we are asked to base our decision on a point, which is not urged in the Statement of the Case, and which, in accordance with the rules of practice of this Court, cannot ordinarily be entertained.\\r\\nThe second point urged by Mr. Setalvad is based on section 65 of the Bengal Act, which runs as follows : \"No suit shall be brought in any Civil Court to set aside or modify any assessment made under this Act, and no prosecution, suit or other proceeding shall lie against any officer of the Crown for anything in good faith done or intended to be done under this Act.\" Strictly speaking, this section does not apply to the present case, as there has yet been no assessment and ex facie the appellant \\'s suit cannot be regarded as a suit to set aside or modify any assessment.\\r\\nMr. Setalvad however contends that this section must be read with the decision of the Privy Council in Raleigh Investment Co. vs Governor General in Council(1).\\r\\nThat was a case under the Indian Incometax Act, 1922, the provisions of which are similar to the provisions of the Bengal Act and which contains a sec tion (section67) which is almost identical in terms with section 65 of the latter Act.\\r\\nIn that case, an assessee paid under protest the tax assessed on him and then brought a suit for the following reliefs : (a) a declaration that certain provisions of the Income tax Act on which the assessment was based were ultra vires and so the assessment was illegal; (b) an injunction restraining the.\\r\\nIncome tax Depart ment from making the assessments in future; (c) repayment of the sum assessed.\\r\\nIt was strongly contended upon the facts of the case that section 67 of the Income tax Act had no application, but it was held by the Privy Council that \"though in form the relief claimed did not profess to (1) 5 34 modify or set aside the assessment, in substance it did,because the repayment could not be ordered so long as the assessment stood \\' \\'.\\r\\nIt was further held that an as sessment made under the machinery provided by the Act, if based on a provision subsequently held to be ultra vires was not a nullity but a mistake of law in the course of its exercise.\\r\\nLastly, it was held that the Act contained machin ery which enabled an assessee to raise the question whether or not a particular provision of the Act bearing on the assessment made upon him was ultra vires and that jurisdic tion to question the assessment otherwise than by use of the machinery expressly provided by the Act appeared to be inconsistent with the statutory obligation to pay \\'arising by virtue of the assessment.\\r\\nThe material part of the judgment on the last point runs as follows : \"In construing the section it is pertinent in their Lord ships \\' opinion, to ascertain whether the Act contains machinery which enables an assessee effectively to raise in the Courts the question whether the particular provision of the Income tax Act bearing on the assessment made is or is not ultra vires.\\r\\nThe presence of such machinery, though by no means conclusive, marches with a construction of the section which denies an alternative jurisdiction to enquire into the same subject matter.\\r\\nThe absence of such machinery would greatly assist the appellant on the question of con struction and, indeed, it may be added that, if there were no such machinery and if the section affected to preclude the High Court in its ordinary civil jurisdiction from considering a point of ultra vires, there would be a serious question whether the opening part of the section, so far as it debarred the question of ultra vires being debated, fell within the competence of the Legislature.\\r\\nIn their Lordships view it is clear that the In come tax Act, 1922, as it stood at the relevant, date,did give the assessee the right effectively to raise inrelation to an assessment made upon him the question whether or not a provision in the Act was ultra vires.\\r\\nUnder section 30, an assessee whose only ground of complaint was that effect had been given in the assessment 35 to a provision which he contended was ultra vires might appeal against the assessment.\\r\\nIf he were dissatisfied with the decision on appeal the details relating to the procedure are immaterial the assessee could ask for a case to be stated on any question of law for the opinion of the High Court and, if his request were refused, he might apply to the High Court for an order requiring a case to be stated and to be referred to the High Court .\\r\\nIt cannot be doubted that included in the questions of law which might be raised by a case stated is any question as to the validity of any taxing provision in the Income tax Act to which effect has been given in the assessment under review.\\r\\nAny decision of the High Court upon that question of law can be reviewed on appeal.\\r\\nEffective and appropriate machinery is therefore provided by the Act itself for the review on grounds of law of any assessment.\\r\\nIt is in that setting that section 67 has to be construed.\\r\\nIn conclusion their Lordships would observe that the scheme of the Act is to set up a particular machinery by the use of which alone total income assessable for income tax is to be ascertained.\\r\\nThe income tax exigible is determined by reference to the total income so ascertained and only by reference to such total income.\\r\\nUnder the Act (section 45) there arises a duty to pay the amount of tax demanded on the basis of that assessment of total income.\\r\\nJurisdiction to ques tion the assessment otherwise than by use of the machinery expressly provided by the Act would appear to be inconsist ent with the statutory obligation to pay arising by virtue of the assessment.\\r\\nThe only doubt, indeed, in their Lord ships \\' mind, is whether an express provision was necessary in order to exclude jurisdiction in a civil Court to set aside or modify an assessment.\\r\\n\" The authority of this decision was not questioned before us, but it was pointed out firstly that the present suit is not hit by the first part of section 65 of the Bengal Act, which refers only to suits to set aside or modify any as sessment, and secondly, that if the case is not covered by section65, the decision of the Privy Council, which was based on the construction of section 36 67 of the Income tax Act, is not applicable.\\r\\nMr. Setalvad, replying to the first contention, has urged that we must not look merely to the letter of the section but to the princi ple underlying it, and he has particularly referred us to the fact that, strictly speaking, the reliefs claimed in the above mentioned case do not fall within the letter of sec tion 67 of the Income tax Act and hence the Privy Council observed in that case: \"In form the relief claimed does not profess to modify or set aside, the assessment.\\r\\nIn sub stance it does .\\r\\nThe cloud of words fails to obscure the point of the suit.\\r\\n\" However that may be, it seems to me that the Privy Council in arriving at their decision, were influenced not only by the language of section 67 of the Income tax Act but also by the complete machinery furnished by that Act for dealing with all questions arising in regard to the assessment, including the question of ultra vires as would appear from the fact that while laying down that there was no jurisdiction to question the assessment except by use of the machinery expressly provided by the Act, their Lord ships added: \"The only doubt, indeed, in their Lordships \\' mind, is whether an express provision was necessary in order to exclude jurisdiction in a civil court to set aside or modify an assessment.\" think that, for the purpose of understanding the full scope of section 65, we must read not only the first part of the section which bars suits to set aside or modify an assessment, but also its latter part which provides that \"no suit or other proceeding shall lie against any officer of the Crown for anything in good faith. intended to be done under this Act.\" The latter part of the section clearly excludes the jurisdiction of the court to prevent the Income tax Officer from proceeding With an assessment which has already been started.\\r\\nReference may here be made to Secretary of State vs Meyyappa Chetti ar(1) where it was held that the expression \"intended to be done\" signified futurity so as to preclude suits for injunction in respect of proceedings \\'intended \\' to be taken by the Income tax Officer.\\r\\nIt is true that in terms the provision concerns the Income tax Officer only, but it (1) I1946] , at 352.\\r\\n37 could hardly have been the intention of the Legislature that though that Officer is not liable to be restrained from proceeding with an assessment, the provision which ensures such a result may be rendered nugatory by permitting an injunction to be claimed against the Provincial Government or the State.\\r\\nIn my opinion, it will be a strange construc tion of the section to hold that although it bars suits to modify or set aside an assessment and though it bars all proceedings to restrain the Officer who is making the as sessment from proceeding with it, yet it leaves it open to a party to stop an assessment by claiming an injunction against the Provincial Government or the State instead of the Officer concerned.\\r\\nThere is no reference to the Provincial Government or the State at all in the first or the second part of the section, but the section as a whole concerns only with excluding the jurisdiction of the civil court in regard to certain acts done or intended to be done in connection with the assessment of agricultural income tax, and, on a fair construction, it must be held to bar all suits in connection with such assessment.\\r\\nIn urging his third point, the learned Attorney General relied on an Ordinance passed by the Governor General of Pakistan on the 13th November, 1948, section 2 whereof runs as follows : \"No judgment, decree, order or sentence referred to in paragraph (3) of Article 4 of the Indian Independence (Legal Proceedings) Order, 1947, shall affect the legislative or executive right or authority of the Central or any Provin cial Government of Pakistan and where such right or authori ty has been at issue, the judgment, decree, order or sen tence shall be invalid and inoperative subject to any decision that may be obtained from a competent court, of the Province concerned.\\r\\n\" It was pointed out that by reason of this Ordinance, any decree which may be obtained in the present suit would be wholly infructuous and in this view this was a meaningless litigation which should not be allowed to continue.\\r\\nThere is force in this argument, 38 but the point need not be pursued, as, in my opinion, the first two points raised by the Attorney General are suffi cient to meet the principal contention advanced by the appellant.\\r\\nThe question of submission to jurisdiction appears to me to be unarguable upon the facts stated, and it was not seriously argued before us.\\r\\nThe Province of East Bengal did intervene and apply for permission to file a written state ment, but the only statement made by it was that the Court had no jurisdiction to proceed with the suit.\\r\\nIt cannot therefore be held that it had submitted to the jurisdiction of the Court.\\r\\nI have tried to deal with the question posed in this appeal in all its material aspects, but it can, I think, be disposed of on the simple ground that the mere issuing of a notice under section 4 of the Bengal Agricultural Income tax Act by the Agricultural Income tax Officer cannot be held to be an actionable wrong, because no right known to law can be said to have been infringed thereby.\\r\\nOne of the recognized tests of an actionable wrong is that, while other remedies may also be open to the person to whom the wrong is done, he can always maintain an action for damages, on the principle that every injury imports damage.\\r\\nI am however certain that no action for damages can be maintained on the allegations made by the appellant in his plaint.\\r\\nI think that the entire argument urged on behalf of the appellant has been sufficiently answered by the High Court in the following passage, which appears to me to sum up the legal position accurately and concisely : \"Nor was Dr. Sen Gupta right in relying on article 10 (2) for the transfer of liabilities.\\r\\nThat Article is con cerned with liability for an actionable wrong other than breach of contract and it is impossible to say that by serving a notice on the plaintiff under the Bengal Agricul tural Income Tax Act through one of its officers, the Prov ince of Bengal had committed an actionable wrong.\\r\\nAssuming it exceeded its powers or acted under an invalid provision of law, the plaintiff may have a declaration to that effect, but the 39 act complained of cannot be said to have been a tortious act.\\r\\nBut even assuming it was, it is to be remembered that the issue of the notice was in exercise of powers conferred by the Act in relation to the Sovereign rights of the Crown and it is elementary that the Crown or the State is not answerable for even negligent or tortious acts of its offi cers done in the Course of their official duties imposed by statute, except where the particular act was specifically directed and the Crown profited by its performance.\\r\\nThere is no such allegation in the plaint in the present case.\\r\\nThe plaintiff could not therefore have sued the Province of Bengal for an actionable wrong and the suit actually brought is not a suit of that character.\\r\\nIt is a suit for ,certain declarations and an injunction and does not seek to make the Province liable for any actionable wrong in any way.\\r\\nNo liability for an actionable wrong is thus involved in the suit and Dr. Sen Gupta cannot establish a right to proceed against the Province of East Bengal on the basis that the liability was transferred to that Province under article 10 (2) of the Order.\\r\\n\" In the result, I would dismiss this appeal with costs.\\r\\nMUKHERJEA J I agree with my learned brother Patanjali Sastri J. that this appeal should be allowed and I would desire to indicate briefly the reasons that have weighed with me in coming to a conclusion different from that ar rived at by the learned Judges of the Calcutta High Court.\\r\\nAll the material facts in relation to this case have been set out with elaborate fullness in the judgment of the High Court and I deem it quite unnecessary to state them over again.\\r\\nThe whole controversy centers round the point as to whether the suit which was instituted by the plaintiff appellant against the Province of Bengal, as it was prior to the 15th of August, 1947, and which is still pending in the Court of the Subordinate Judge at Alipore can be continued against the Province of East Bengal which has come into existence, as a part of the Dominion of Pakistan, upon the 40 partition of Bengal under the Indian Independence Act; and whether the court of the Subordinate Judge of Alipore which is a court in the Dominion of India has any jurisdiction to proceed with and try such suit.\\r\\nThe Subordinate JUdge decided these questions in favour of the plaintiff appellant basing his decision entirely upon article 4 (1) of the Indian Independence (Legal proceedings) Order, 1947, read with section 9 of the Indian Independence Act.\\r\\nThe High Court in revision \\' set aside the order of the Subordinate Judge holding inter alia that neither article 4 (1) of the Legal Proceedings Order nor article 12 (2) of the Indian Independence (Rights, Property and Liabilities) Order, 1947, could confer upon the plaintiff any right to continue the suit against the Province of East Bengal.\\r\\nThe Alipore Court, it has been held, has no jurisdiction to proceed with the suit and no jurisdiction has been conferred upon it by reason of the Province of East Bengal appearing in the suit and putting in a written statement only for the purpose of challenging the competency of the court to try the same.\\r\\nIt is the propriety of this decision that has been challenged before us in this appeal.\\r\\nThe first point that requires consideration is whether article 4 (11 of the Legal Proceedings Order has any appli cation to the facts of the present case.\\r\\nIn my opinion, the answer to this question must be in the negative and the view taken by the High Court on this point seems to me to be perfectly sound and unassailable.\\r\\nThe Legal Proceedings Order as well as several other orders dealing with various constitutional matters affecting the two Dominions which were to come into being on and from the 15th of August, 1947, were promulgated by the Governor General of India just on the previous day, that is to say, the 14th of August, 1947, in pursuance of section 9 (1) of the Indian Independence Act which made it a duty on the part of the Governor General to make suitable provisions for removing the difficulties arising in connection with the transition to the new constitutional order.\\r\\nAs the two 41 Dominions came into existence under the Indian Independence Act passed by the British Parliament and these orders were made by the Governor General of India in exercise of the authority conferred upon him by the Independence Act, there cannot be any doubt that the provisions of these orders are fully binding on India as well as the Dominion of Pakistan; and they being provisions made to be applicable only for the transitional period, the question does not really arise as to whether or not they are in strict conformity with the principles of International Law which would ordinarily govern the relations between two sovereign States.\\r\\nArticle 4(1) of the Legal Proceedings Order is worded as follows: \"Notwithstanding the creation of certain new Provinces and the transfer of certain territories from the Province of Assam to the Province of East Bengal by the Indian Independ ence Act, 1947, (1) all proceedings pending immediately before the appointed day in any civil or criminal court (other than a High Court) in the Province of Bengal, the Punjab or Assam shall be continued in that court as if the said Act had not been passed, and that court shall continue to have for the purposes of the said proceedings all the jurisdiction and powers which it had immediately before the appointed day.\\r\\n\" The clause of the article is couched in very wide lan guage and under it all proceedings pending in any civil or criminal court in the Province of Bengal, the Punjab or Assam immediately before the 15th of August, 1947, would continue as before and be heard and tried by the courts before which they are pending irrespective of the fact that such proceedings might relate to persons or property situat ed in the other Dominion.\\r\\nI agree with the High Court in holding that comprehensive though the provision is, by itself it can render no assistance to the plaintiff appel lant.\\r\\nThe suit was commenced here by the plaintiff against the old Province of Bengal as the party defendant and against 42 that defendant the suit may be continued if the plaintiff so chooses under article 4(1) of the Legal Proceedings Order mentioned above.\\r\\nBut this would be of no benefit or advan tage to the plaintiff for what he wants is to proceed against the Province of East Bengal which is a part of the Dominion of Pakistan as a substituted defendant in place of the Province of Bengal.\\r\\nDr. Sen Gupta argues that if the court has jurisdiction to continue the suit, this would necessarily carry with it the power to make proper orders for substitution as the court considers necessary.\\r\\nBut such substitution could be made only under the ordinary provi sions of law which regulate the conduct of such suits.\\r\\nThere is no provision of any municipal law which contemplates or authorises the substitution of one sovereign state for another in a pending suit.\\r\\nIf, therefore, the plaintiff wants to proceed against the new Province of East Bengal, he must find warrant for it in some of the provisions made by the Governor General of Indian exercise of the powers vested in him under the Indian Independence Act.\\r\\nAdmittedly there is no such provision in the Legal Proceedings Act and reli ance is, therefore, placed by the plaintiff upon article 12 (2) of the Rights, Property and Liabilities Order, 1947, which is in the following terms : \"Where any Province from which property, rights or liabilities are transferred by this Order is, immediately before the transfer, a party to legal proceeding with re spect to that property or those rights or liabilities, the Province which succeeds to the property, rights or liabili ties in accordance with the provisions of this Order shall be deemed to be substituted for the other Province as a party to those proceedings, and the proceedings may con tinue accordingly.\\r\\nIt is not disputed that in order to attract the opera tion of this provision, it is incumbent upon the plaintiff to show that the right or liability to which his suit re lates has been transferred from the Province of Bengal, as it existed prior to the 15th of August, 1947, 43 to the Province of East Bengal in Pakistan in accordance with the provisions of this Order.\\r\\nTo establish this, reli ance was placed on behalf of the plaintiff upon several provisions of the Rights, Property and Liabililies Order, 1947, and none of his contentions in this respect were accepted as sound by the learned Judges of the High Court.\\r\\nIn this court Dr. Sen Gupta took his stand on a two fold ground.\\r\\nHe argued in the first place that for the purpose of invoking the aid of article 12(2) of the Rights, Proper ty \\' and Liabilities Order it is not necessary that the transfer of the right and liability to which the proceeding relates should take place under any of the specific articles enumerated in the Order.\\r\\nIt would be enough according to him, if there is a transfer by or under any machinery which the Order sets up or authorises What he says is that as the Province of East Bengal is proceeding to assess and levy agricultural income tax upon the plaintiff in respect of a period anterior to 15th of August, 1947, the right to do so can vest in the Province either under an agreement between the two Dominions or the two Provinces or on the basis of an award by an arbitral tribunal as contemplated by article 3 of the Rights, Property and Liabilities Order.\\r\\nIn either case it would amount to transfer of rights under the provi sions of the Order and would attract the operation of arti cle 12(2).\\r\\nThis argument is manifestly unsound and cannot be ac cepted.\\r\\nIf the right referred to by the learned Counsel means the fight to impose tax on agricultural income earned within its territory, the State of Pakistan did not acquire such right by transfer from the Province of Bengal.\\r\\nIt is a right inherent in sovereignty itself which the Dominion of Pakistan got under the Indian Independence Act.\\r\\nAgain if the right has been created by the Bengal Agricultural In come tax Act, the Province of East Bengal would certainly be entitled to avail itself of the provisions of that Act under section 18(3) of the Independence Act.\\r\\nApart from this, Dr. Sen Gupta has not referred us to any agreement between the two Dominions or the two Provinces or to the decision of any arbitral tribunal 44 under which the right in dispute in the present case was transferred to the Province of East Bengal.\\r\\nThis contention must therefore fail.\\r\\nI have now to consider the other argument on this point advanced by the learned Counsel that the liability of the Province of Bengal in respect to the cause of action upon which the plaintiff \\'s suit had been rounded became a liabil ity of the Province of East Bengal under the provision of article 10(2) of the Rights, Property and Liabilities Order.\\r\\nIt is not disputed that if this contention succeeds, the plaintiff would be entitled to the benefit of clause (2) of article 12 of the Order.\\r\\nClause (2) of article 10 has to be read with clause (1) of that article and taking the two clauses together the provision of article 10(2) would stand thus : \"Where immediately before the appointed day the Province of Bengal is subject to any liability in respect of an actionable wrong other than a breach of contract, the li ability shall (a) when the cause of action arose wholly within the territory which as from that day are the territories of the Province of East Bengal be a liability of that Province.\\r\\n\" If the allegations made by the plaintiff in the plaint are assumed to be correct, the Province of Bengal was liable to be restrained from proceeding to levy agricultural income tax upon the plaintiff which was illegal, as being imposed by a statute which so far as it affected the plain tiff was unconstitutional and void.\\r\\nThe question is whether this can be said to be a liability in respect of an action able wrong other than a breach of contract within the meaning of that expression occurring in article 10 set out above.\\r\\nIt may be noted here that the rights and liabilities arising out of contracts have been dealt with in articles 8 and 9 of the Order.\\r\\nThe High Court took the view that the expression \"actionable wrong other than a breach contract\" is synonymous with \\'tort \\'.\\r\\nIt has held that the act com plained of cannot be a tortious act and 45 even if it is so, no action would lie upon it, it being an established proposition of law that the State is not answer able for any tortious acts of its officers done in the course of official duties imposed by a Statute.\\r\\nIt seems to me that the learned Judges have attached a narrow and some what restricted meaning to the words of the Article men tioned above and that the plain language of the provision read in the light of the context would demand and justify a wider and more liberal interpretation.\\r\\nIn my opinion, there can be an actionable wrong which does not arise out of a breach of contract and at the same time does not answer to the description of a \\'tort \\' as it is understood in English law; and if the plaintiff \\'s allegations are correct, it is an actionable wrong precisely of that type which we have in the present case.\\r\\nThe word \"wrong\" in ordinary legal language means and signifies \"privation of right\".\\r\\nAn act is wrongful it infringes the legal right of another, and \"actionable\" means nothing else than that it affords grounds for action in law.\\r\\nOrdinarily, the word \"injury\" is used in the same sense of actionable wrong, while \"damage in contrast with injury means loss or harm occurring in fact whether actionable as injury or not\"(1).\\r\\nIn English law \"tort\" is a species of civil injury and so is a breach of contract; but it is not quite correct to say that the two together exhaust all forms of actionable wrongs known to English law.\\r\\nIt is true that a tort is often described as wrong independent of contract.\\r\\nAs a legal definition this description, as I shall show presently, is not quite accurate and unless taken with certain limitations is apt to be misleading.\\r\\nIt is well known that in England the principles of modern law of contract and tort emerged solely out of the intricacies of the old \"Forms of Action \\'\" under which they lay buried for ages.\\r\\nThe injuries which in modern law are described as torts were remedied in early time by certain writs, known as writs of trespass (1) Vide the observation of Viscount Simon in Crofter etc.\\r\\nCompany Ltd vs Vetch ; , 442. 46 and trespass on the case.\\r\\nThe latter was more elastic than the former and was capable of being adapted to new circum stances and to new types of injuries.\\r\\nThere was no clear line of demarcation in those days between contractual and tortious liability and in fact tile aCtiOn of \"assumpsit\" which was the method of enforcing simple contracts was a variety of action on the case and was made use of for recov ery of compensation from a party who failed to perform his agreement on the ground that such failure amounted to a wrong in the nature of deceit(1).\\r\\nWhen the principles of substantive law gradually extri cated themselves from the entanglements of for realistic procedure, a distinction was drawn between liability for breach of contract and that for tort.\\r\\nIn a breach of con tract the right violated owes its origin to the agreement of the parties while in tort the right infringed is one created by tile general law of the land.\\r\\nFrom about the middle of the 19th century the assumption current in England was that all civil causes of action must be rounded either on con tract or on tort and all injuries which were not breaches of contract would come under the category of torts.\\r\\nThis as sumption as Sir Frederick Pollock observes has no historical foundation to rest upon(2).\\r\\nIn 1852 the Common Law Proce dure Act was passed and a tort was described in the Act as \"a wrong independent of contract\".\\r\\nIt cannot be denied that this mode of expression became very common in legal par lance; but as more than one modern writer on the law of torts have pointed out, the words in such description would have to be interpreted in a particular way and with certain limitations; taken literally it would not be a correct statement of law.\\r\\nIt has been observed by Underhill in his \"Law of Torts\" that a description like this would be accurate in law if the word \"wrong\" is taken in the restricted and technical sense as equivalent to \"violation of a right (1) Vide Pollock on Contract, 12th Edition, p. 111; Winfield on Tort pp, 3 4 (4th Edition).\\r\\n(2) Vide Pollock \\'s Article on Tort, Encyc.\\r\\nVol.22, p. 307.\\r\\n47 recognised and enforced by law by means of an action for damages\".\\r\\nTaken in this form, the definition though it gives no clue as to what constitutes a wrong, certainly does lay stress on the essential characteristic of a tort, viz., that the appropriate remedy f9r it is an action for damages(1).\\r\\nIt is really this characteristic that differen tiates a tort from other forms of civil injury or actionable wrong even though the latter are unconnected with any con tract.\\r\\nThere may be other remedies besides damages avail able to the plaintiff against a tortfeasor in the shape of restitution, injunction etc.\\r\\n, but no \"civil injury\" as Salmond observes \"can be classed as tort unless the appro priate remedy for it is an action for damages.\\r\\nSuch an action is an essential characteristic of every true tort.\\r\\n\"(2) Other remedies like injunction or restitution can be claimed by the plaintiff but it is solely by virtue of a right to damages that the wrong complained of can be regard ed as a tort.\\r\\nBy way of illustration the author points out that a public nuisance is not to be deemed a tort, because the civil remedy by way of injunction may be obtained at the suit of the Attorney General.\\r\\nA refusal to perform a statu tory duty is not a tort if the remedy is by way of mandamus.\\r\\nNor would any wrong be regarded as a tort if the remedy is not an action for unliquidated damages but for a liquidated sum of money.\\r\\nA breach of trust is certainly an actionable wrong independent of contract and the beneficiaries can claim compensation if the trustee has misappropriated trust property; but as the claim cannot be for unliquidated damages, it is not regarded as a tort(3).\\r\\nAccording to Salmond, the reason for this exclusion is purely historical as a breach of trust or any other equitable obligation was considered to be within the special jurisdiction of equity courts.\\r\\nIt is interesting to observe that although the difference between equitable and common law jurisdiction is not existent at the present day, the old rule is still applied (1) Vide Underbill \\'s Law of Torts.\\r\\n16th Edn., p. 4.\\r\\n(2) Vide Salmond \\'s Law of Torts, 10th Edn., pp. 7 & 8.\\r\\n(3) Vide Winfield \\'s Law of Tort, p. 11 48 to demarcate the boundary of the law of torts in English common law.\\r\\nThus tort is a civil injury other than a breach of contract which is capable of sustaining an action for unliq uidated damages in a court of law.\\r\\nIf the appropriate remedy is not a claim for unliquidated damages but for injunction or some other relief, it would not rank as a tort though all the same it would be an actionable wrong.\\r\\nBy way of illustration I may refer to the case of Halsey vs Brotherhood(1) which was decided by Sir George Jessel.\\r\\nBoth the plaintiff and defendant in this case were engineers and held patents for the manufacture of certain types of engines.\\r\\nThe plaintiff brought an action against the de fendant alleging that the latter had threatened to bring legal proceedings against several persons who were actual or intending purchasers of engines from the plaintiff assert ing that the engines manufactured by the plaintiff were infringements of the defendant \\'s patent.\\r\\nThere was a claim for damages and also for injunction.\\r\\nIt was held by Sir George Jessel that the plaintiff could not claim damages on the basis of slander of title, as he nowhere alleged that the defendant \\'s statements or representations were not bona fide.\\r\\nBut even though the statements had been made in good faith, the plaintiff would be entitled to an injunction against the defendant if he succeeded in proving that the latter \\'s allegations of infringement were not true.\\r\\nAs no proper case for injunction on this basis was made in the claim, the action was dismissed; but liberty was given to the plaintiff to bring an action in the proper form claiming an injunction to restrain the defendant from threatening the plaintiff \\'s customers.\\r\\nThis threat to customers was thus held to be an actionable wrong but as the remedy was injunc tion and not damages, it was not a tort in the legal sense of the term.\\r\\nIn the case before us the act of the Province of Bengal complained of by the plaintiff is not a tort according to the technical rules (1) 49 of English law, but is certainly an actionable wrong as it can be sued upon in a court of law and remedied in an effective manner.\\r\\nThe appropriate remedy for the wrong is not unliquidated damages which is essential in a tort but an injunction restraining the defendant from proceeding with the illegal assessment or from realising the amount assessed if assessment has actually taken place.\\r\\nIf, as the plaintiff alleges, the relevant provision of the Bengal Agricultural Income tax Act, under which the plaintiff is sought to be assessed, is illegal and ultra vires, the issuing of the notice by the Income tax Officer is certainly the first and the essential step in the commis sion of the wrongful act which furnishes a sufficient cause of action for the suit.\\r\\nAs this is not a case of tort, the principle of law, according to which a state is not liable to any damages for tortious acts of its servants, cannot be invoked as a bar to the suit.\\r\\nA remedy by way of injunction can be claimed against a State or Province unless the act complained of amounts to an \\'act of State \\' in its strict sense and is not purported to be done in exercise of the powers conferred upon the Government by any municipal law.\\r\\nAs the avowed object of the Rights, Property and Liabilities Order is to distribute and adjust as far as possible the rights, properties and liabilities between the two Dominions which were to come into being under the Indian Independence Act, the language of the Order should be construed as liber ally as possible, and there is no warrant for putting an interpretation upon the words used more restricted than they would bear in English law.\\r\\nIt is argued that article 10(2) (a) does not apply to this case as the cause of action did not wholly arise within the territory of the Province of East Bengal.\\r\\nThe argument does not impress me at all.\\r\\nThe notice was issued by the Income tax Officer of Dacca which is in Pakistan territory though it was received by the plaintiff \\'s manager at Agarta la which was outside British India at that time.\\r\\nIn any event, the Province 50 of East Bengal cannot escape liability on this ground.\\r\\nIt would be jointly liable with the Province of West Bengal under article 10(2) (c) of the Rights, Property and Liabili ties Order.\\r\\nIn view of my decision on this point, the other question raised by Dr. Sen Gupta as to whether the defendant submit ted to the jurisdiction of the Alipore Court or not does not fall for determination.\\r\\nThe learned Attorney General, who intervened on behalf of the Union of India, put forward certain additional grounds in support of the order made by the learned Judges of the High Court.\\r\\nOne of the points raised by him is that section 65 of the Bengal Agricultural Income tax Act con stitutes a bar to the suit which, therefore, should not be allowed to \\'continue.\\r\\nThe other material point is that the suit cannot but result in an infructuous decree, and conse quently there is no justification for allowing it to pro ceed.\\r\\nIt is pointed out that an Ordinance has been passed by the GovernorGeneral of Pakistan on the 13th of November, 1948, under which \"no judgment, decree or order referred to in paragraph 3 of Article 4 of the Indian Independence (Legal Proceedings) Order, 1947, shall, in any way, affect the legislative or executive right or authority of the Central or any Provincial Government of Pakistan and where such authority or right has been at issue, the judgment, decree or order shall be invalid and inoperative\".\\r\\nThe first point has been dealt with by my learned brother Patan jali Sastri J. in his judgment and I concur with him in holding that section 65 of the Bengal Agricultural Income tax Act has no application to the present case.\\r\\nThe second point, I must say, embarrassed me to some extent and if the effect of the Ordinance is, as has been stated by the learned Attorney General, a doubt may legitimately arise whether it would be worthwhile for the plaintiff to proceed with the suit and whether it would not be more to his advan tage to seek relief in the court of Dacca.\\r\\nBut as this point was not raised before the High Court and the question whether an Ordinance of this character could override the provisions of the 51 Orders passed by the Governor General of India under the Indian Independence Act has still to be decided, I refrain from expressing any opinion on this point.\\r\\nIn the result, the appeal, in my opinion, should be allowed and I concur in the order which has been made by my learned brother Patanjali Sastri, J. Appeal allowed.\\r\\nAgent for the Appellant: R.R. Biswas.\\r\\nAgent for the Respondent: P.K. Bose.\\r\\nAgent for the Inervener: P.

Mukherjee, with him) for the appellants.\\r\\nPanchanan Ghose, (P. C. Chatterjee, with him) for the respondent.\\r\\nMay 4. \\'the following judgments were delivered : DAS J.\\r\\nThis appeal arises out of a suit filed by the appellants on January 2, 1941, in the Court of the Subordi nate Judge, Asansole.\\r\\nThat suit came to be filed in circum stances which may now be stated shortly.\\r\\nA suit had been instituted by one Kumar Dakhineswar Malia against Rameswar Malia, Rani Bhaba Sundari and others for partition of the Searsole Raj Estate.\\r\\nOne Bhagabati Charan Mitra was appointed receiver of that estate in that suit.\\r\\nOn August 10, 1908, the said receiver with the permis sion of the Court which had appointed him as receiver grant ed two mining leases, each for 999 years one in respect of 5/16 share of the Malias in Mouza Monohar Bahal and the other in respect of 230 bighas in village Marich Kota to a firm then carrying on business under the name and style of Laik Banerjee & Company.\\r\\nOn the same day the said receiver with like permission mortgaged these properties to the said firm as security for the due repayment of the loan of Rs. 100,000 advanced by that firm.\\r\\nThe Malias joined the re ceiver in executing the aforesaid leases and the mortgage.\\r\\nAs a result of these transactions the firm of Laik Banerjee & Company became the lessees for 999 years of the two properties as well as the mortgagee of the lessors \\' interest in the same.\\r\\nBy diverse processes not necessary to be detailed, the appellants have become the successors in interest of the mortgagors and the respondent Deva Prasanna Mukerjee has become the successor in interest of the mortga gee under the mortgage of August 10, 1908.\\r\\n575 On March 31, 1922, Deva Prasanna filed suit No. 78 of 1922 for enforcing the mortgage of 1908.\\r\\nPreliminary decree was passed in the last mentioned suit on \\' July 31, 1928, and a final decree for sale was made I on February 26, 1929.\\r\\nIn execution of this final decree the mortgaged properties were sold at a Court i sale and were purchased by Deva Prasanna for \\' Rs. 59,000.\\r\\nThis sale was confirmed by the Court on June 30, 1931.\\r\\nA large sum remaining still due to Deva Prasanna, he applied for, and on October 30, 1935, obtained a personal decree for Rs. 1,27,179 0 6 against Raja Pramatha Nath Malia who had by inheritance acquired the lessors \\' interest and become the borrower.\\r\\nIn 1936, Deva Prasanna started execution case No. 118 of 1936 for execution of the personal decree and attached certain properties alleging that the same belonged to the Raja.\\r\\nThe exact date of the attachment does not appear from the printed record.\\r\\nThe Raja as Sibait of a certain deity and his two sons, the appellants before us, objected to the attachment of these properties and filed a claim case.\\r\\nNegotiations for settlement started and eventually, on January 30, 1937, a petition (exhibit 2) was filed in the exe cuting Court stating as follows : \"The judgment debtor having made special requests to the decree holder for an amicable settlement of the aforesaid execution case, the decree holder has agreed to the same.\\r\\nBut some time is required to settle the talks and all the terms etc.\\r\\nThe judgment debtor has paid to the decree holder the costs of this execution amounting to Rs. 76 14 0, and he having made requests for this execution case being struck off for the present on keeping the attachment in force, the decreeholder has agreed to it.\\r\\nIt is, therefore, prayed that under the circumstances aforesaid, the Court may be pleased to strike off this execution case keeping the attachment in force.\" Neither the original nor a certified copy of the order made on that date by the executing Court on the 576 above petition is forthcoming but the parties have definite ly agreed that the order is substantially and correctly entered in column 20 of exhibit F which is a certified copy of extract from the Register of applications for executions of decrees relating to execution Case No. 118 of 1936.\\r\\nThe heading of column 20 is \\'Date on which execution case was finally disposed of and purport of final order.\\r\\n\" The entry in column 20 under that head is: \"D. H. admits receipt of Rs. 76 14/ as costs of this case from the J.D.\\r\\nThe execution case is dismissed for non prosecution the attachment already effected in this case continuing.\\r\\n30th January 1937.\\r\\n\" The entry under column 11 of that very exhibit reads as follows : \"Claim case automatically drops as the execution case is dismissed.\\r\\nIt is, therefore, rejected without any sort of adjudication.\\r\\n30th January 1937.\\r\\n\" In May 1937, the Searsole Raj Estate came under the charge of the Court of Wards.\\r\\nBy a Kobala executed with the permission of the Board of Revenue Raja Pramatha Nath Malia and his two sons Kumars Pashupati Nath Malia and Kshitipati Nath Malia represented by Kumar Kshitipati Nath Malia as the Manager of the Searsole Raj Wards Estate conveyed a property known as Senapati Mahal to Deva Prasanna in full settlement of his claim under the personal decree against the Raja.\\r\\nBy an agreement of even date, Deva Prasanna agreed to reconvey Senapati Mahal to the Kumars if he was paid Rs. 90,000/ within two years from that date.\\r\\nSenapati Mahal orginally belonged to the Raja but had been tranSferred by him to his two sons.\\r\\nA creditor, however, had filed a suit under sec tion 53 of the Transfer of Property Act challenging that transfer and had actually got a decree declaring that trans fer as fradulent and void as against the creditors of the Raja 577 An appeal was filed by the Kumars which was pending at the date of the Kobala of January 4, 1939, and, in the circum stances, it was considered safer to join the Raja in the last mentioned Kobala in favour of Deva Prasanna.\\r\\nOn June 2, 1939, a petition was filed in the Court of the Subordinate Judge, Asansole, on behalf of Deva Prasanna as the decree holder.\\r\\nIt was headed \"Money Execution Case No. 118 of 1936.\\r\\nThe relevant portions of this petition were as follows; \"That the above execution case was disposed of on the 30th January 1937 with the attachment of the properties subsisting; since then the decree put into execution in the above case has been adjusted after remission of a large amount of interest by the out and out sale of certain properties by a registered Kobala dated 4th January 1939 . . . . . . . . .So there is no longer any need of the said attachment remaining subsisting.\\r\\nIt is, therefore, prayed that the attachment may be withdrawn.\\r\\n\" On the same day the following order was made on that petition: \" Heard learned pleaders for the parties.\\r\\nThey jointly ask me to cancel the attachment (existing by special order) in Money exhibit 118 of 1936 though that case was dismissed.\\r\\nOrder The said attachment is cancelled and the decree in question is recorded as adjusted as stated by learned plead er for the decree holder and pleader of the judgment debtor according to the adjustment mentioned but not detailed in this petition of to day.\\r\\nMake necessary notes and send this petition to the District Record Room.\\r\\n\" In the remarks column No. 22 in exhibit F the following entry was made : \"The said attachment is cancelled and the decree in question is recorded as adjusted as stated by learned 578 pleader for the D.H. and the pleader of the Judgment Debtor according to the adjustment mentioned but not detailed in this petition of to day.\\r\\nDated 2nd June 1989.\\r\\n\" The Raja died in August, 1940, leaving the two appellants as his sons and legal representatives.\\r\\nThe Bengal Money Lend ers Act, 1940 (Bengal Act X of 1940) hereinafter called the Act, came into force on September 1, 1940.\\r\\nOn January 2, 1941, the appellants who, as the legal representatives of the Raja, became \"borrowers\" within the meaning of the Act filed the suit out of which the present appeal has arisen.\\r\\nThe suit was filed by the appellants against the respondent under section 36 of the Act praying for reopening the trans actions and taking accounts and for release from all liabil ities in excess of the limits specified by law.\\r\\nIn short, they asked the Court to give them relief by exercising the powers given to the Court by section 36 of the Act.\\r\\nThere was also a prayer for reconveyance of the Senapati Mahal.\\r\\nThe respondent filed his written statement setting up a variety of defences rounded on merits as well as on legal pleas in bar.\\r\\nOn May 8, 1941, the Subordinate Judge settled the issues and fixed June 9, 1941, \"for a preliminary hear ing of the suit and particularly of such of the issues as have been based on the pleas in bar.\" Eventually, the case was taken up for preliminary hearing on September 4, 1941, and by his judgment delivered on September 8, 1941, the learned Subordinate Judge dismissed the suit on issue No. 2 which was as follows: \"Does the plaint disclose a valid cause of action for the suit ?\" The appellants preferred an appeal to the High Court at Calcutta.\\r\\nAlthough the High Court (R.C. Mitter and K.C. Chunder JJ.) did not accept all the reasonings on which the learned Subordinate Judge had based his decision, they, however, agreed that the appellants could get no relief as the decrees in suit No. 78 of 1922 could not be reopened, as they were not passed in 579 \"a suit to which this Act applies\" and consequently dis missed the appeal.\\r\\nThe appellants have now come up on appeal before us after having obtained a certificate from the High Court under section 110 of the Code of Civil Procedure.\\r\\nLearned Advocate appearing in support of this appeal before us has contended that the High Court was in error in holding that the decrees in Suit No. 78 of 1922 were not liable to be reopened under the second proviso to section 36 (1).\\r\\nLearned advocate for the respondent while joining issue on this point also raised a point which, however, did not find favour with the High Court, namely, that the respondent as a bona fide assignee for value of the mortgage debt was protected by sub section (5) of section 36.\\r\\nIt is quite clear that if either of the two points is decided against the appellants, this appeal must fail.\\r\\nThe main provisions of section 36 (1)are in the follow ing terms : \"Notwithstanding anything contained in any law for the time being in force, if in any suit to which this Act ap plies, or in any suit brought by a borrower for relief under this section, whether heard ex parte or otherwise, the Court has reason to believe that the exercise of one or more of the powers under this section will give relief to the bor rower, it shall exercise all or any of the following powers as it may consider appropriate namely, shall (a) reopen any transaction and take an account between the parties; (b) notwithstanding any agreement, purporting to close previous dealings and to create new obligations, reopen any account already taken between the parties; (c) release the borrower of all liability in excess of the limits specified in clauses (t) and (2) of section 30; (d) if anything has been paid or allowed in account on or after the first day of January, 1939, in respect of the liability referred to in clause (c), order 580 the lender to repay any sum which the Court considers to be repayable in respect of such payment or allowance in account as aforesaid; (e) set aside either wholly or in part or revise or alter any security given or agreement made in respect of any loan, and if the lender has parted with the security, order him to indemnify the borrower in such manner and to such extent as it may deem just.\\r\\n\" It will be noticed (a) that the provisions of this section apply notwithstanding anything contained in any law for the time being in force, (b) that the powers conferred on the Court or to be exercised either in any suit to which this Act applies or in any suit brought by a borrower for relief under the section and (c) that the Court is called upon to exercise all or any of the powers conferred on it by the section if the Court has reason to believe that the exercise of one or more of the powers will give relief to the borrower.\\r\\nIn the present case the borrowers have insti tuted a substantive suit for relief under section 36 and, therefore, if there was nothing also in the section and the Court had the requisite belief, the Court could exercise all or any of the powers and give relief to the borrowers in terms of the prayers of the plaint.\\r\\nThere are, however, two provisions to sub section (1) of section 36.\\r\\nThe relevant portion of the second proviso is expressed in the words following: \"Provided that in exercise of these powers the Court shall not (i) * * * * (ii) do anything which affects any decree of a Court, other than a decree in a suit to which the Act applies which was not fully satisfied by the first day of January, 1939, or * * * *\" The proviso makes it quite clear that in exercise of the powers the Court cannot reopen or otherwise affect a decree of a Court unless such decree is one which was passed in a suit to which this Act applies and \\' which was not fully satisfied by January 1, 1939.\\r\\nIn the light of the decision of the Full Bench of the 581 Calcutta High Court in Mrityunjay Mitra vs Satis Chandra Banerji(1) which was approved by the Privy Council in Jadu Nath Roy vs Kshitish Chandra Acharyya(2), it has not been contended, in view of the fact that the personal decree for the balance remained unsatisfied on January 1, 1939, that the decrees in Suit No. 78 of 1922 were fully satisfied within the meaning of the above proviso.\\r\\nTherefore, the only thing that remains to be ascertained is whether the decrees were passed in \"a suit to which this Act applies.\\r\\n\" Section 2 (22) of the Act is as follows: \"2.\\r\\nIn this Act, unless there is anything repugnant in the subject or context\" (22) \"Suit to which this Act applies \"means any suit or proceeding instituted or filed on or after the 1st day of January, 1939, or pending on that date and includes a pro ceeding in execution (a) for the recovery of a loan advanced before or after the commencement of this Act; (b) for the enforcement of any agreement entered into before or after the commencement of this Act, whether by way of settlement of account or otherwise, or of any security so taken, in respect of any loan advanced whether before or after the commencement of this Act; or (c) for the redemption of any security given before or after the commencement of this Act in respect of any loan advanced whether before or after the commencement of this Act.\\r\\n\" The words \"instituted or filed on or after the 1st day of January, 1939, or pending on that date\" have been read and understood as qualifying the words \"any suit or proceed ing\" in the beginning of the definition as well as the words \"proceeding in execution\" occurring further down: see per Spens C.J. in Bank of \\' Commerce Ltd. vs Amulya Krishna (3).\\r\\nAccordingly, it has (1) I.L.R. 11944) 2Cal. 376; (2) L.R. 76 I.A. 179 at p. 190.\\r\\n(3) ;A.I.R. 1944 F.C. 18.\\r\\n582 been held in Ram Kumar De vs Abhoya Pada Bhattacharjee (1) that where a decree is such that the suit in which it was passed had terminated before January 1, 1939, and no pro ceeding in execution was started or was actually pending on or after that date it is not a decree in \"a suit to which this Act applies\"and cannot be reopened.\\r\\nThe same view was upheld by a Special Bench of the Calcutta High Court in Aparna Kumari vs Girish Chandra (2)which overruled two earlier decisions to the contrary.\\r\\nThe construction put upon section 2 (22)by the Special Bench and the reasons given by them appear to us to be well founded.\\r\\nIn the case now before us, the Suit No. 78 of 1922 was instituted and all the three decrees were passed long before the specified date.\\r\\nThe only question that has therefore, to be consid ered is whether any proceeding in execution was pending on or after that date.\\r\\nThe answer to this question will depend on the true meaning and effect of the orders made by the executing Court (i) on January 30, 1937, and (ii) on June 2, 1939.\\r\\nAs to (i) It is not disputed that the order of January 30, 1937, was made under Order XXI, rule57, as amended by the Calcutta High Court.\\r\\nOrder XXI, rule 57, is expressed in the following terms : \"Where any property has been attached in execution of a decree but by reason of the decree holder \\'s default the Court is unable to proceed further with the application for execution, it shall either dismiss the application or for any sufficient reason adjourn the proceedings to a future date.\\r\\nUpon the dismissal of such application the attachment shall cease.\\r\\n\" The marginal note of the rule is determination of at tachment.\\r\\nThe reason why rule 57 was introduced in the Code of 1908 has been explained by Rank in C.J. in Shibnath Singh Ray vs Sheikh Saberuddin Ahmad(3) as follows: (1) ; (2) (3) I.L.R. at pp.\\r\\n421 422 583 \"Rule 57 of Order XXI was a new provision introduced in 1908.\\r\\nIt is evident from the language of the rule itself, and it is still more evident from the circumstances under which it was passed, that it was intended to provide a remedy for the grievance or inconvenience which is apt to arise, where, after an attachment in execution, the applica tion for execution cannot further be proceeded with by reason of the decree holder \\'s default.\\r\\nThis was, and still is, a very common case.\\r\\nThe decree holder makes some informal arrangement to give the judgment debtor time with out obtaining full satisfaction of the decree ;the applica tion for execution is not further prosecuted; it is not withdrawn; neither party attends.\\r\\nIn these circumstances, the object of the rule is to say that the Court must make either an order for adjournment or an order of dismissal.\\r\\nThe reason why it was necessary to require the Court, if it did not adjourn a proceeding to a definite date, to dismiss the application for execution formally and definitely can be amply illustrated from the decided cases.\\r\\nIn the absence of a definite order of dismissal the files of the Courts became encumbered with a number of applications for execution which were water logged and derelict, and a practice arose whereby such applications were ordered to be \\'struck off. \\' This was a practice not justified by the Code and in cases where attachments in execution had already been entered, the question arose whether the effect of an order \\'striking off \\' was that the attachment made upon application for execution was itself struck off or whether it remained notwithstanding such an order.\\r\\nMany other awkward and important questions arose out of this practice and the object of rule 57 was to ensure that this illogical and inconvenient practice should be stopped.\\r\\nApplications for execution were to be definitely dismissed if they were not adjourned to a future date.\\r\\nThe object of the last sentence in rule 57 is to settle the question whether, when the application in execution is dismissed any attachment made under that application should fall to the ground or should subsist, and 584 the legislature has provided that it is to fall to the ground.\\r\\n\" The new rule thus \\' introduced left two distinct courses open to the executing Court in the situation envisaged by the rule.\\r\\nEach course had its advantage as well as its disadvantage.\\r\\nThus the adjournment of the execution pro ceedings kept the attachment alive without any special direction.\\r\\nWhile the adoption of this course helped bona fide arrangement between the decree holder and the judgment debtor as to the time and manner of satisfaction of the decree it was calculated also to encourage desultory proceedings resulting in undesirable congestion in the files of the Executing Court by keeping alive so many execution proceedings.\\r\\nOn the other hand, while the dismissal of an application in the circumstances mentioned in the rule had the merit of preventing a congestion of the file by finally disposing of the application by a final order, it was calcu lated to discourage decreeholders from giving even reasona ble accommodation to the judgment debtor on account of the destruction of the attachment which left the judgment debtor free to deal with the property to the detriment of the decreeholder after the attachment ceased.\\r\\nIt was evidently with a view to preserve the advantage of a dismissal and at the same time to avoid the disadvantage of the rigid rule of cesser of the attachment that the Calcutta High Court amend ed rule 57 by adding the words \"unless the Court shall make an order to the contrary\" at the end of the last sentence of that rule.\\r\\nThe rule thus amended leaves three courses open to the Executing Court in case it finds it difficult to proceed with the execution case by reason of the default of the decree holder.\\r\\nIt may (1) adjourn the proceedings for good reason which will automatically keep the attachment alive or (2) simply dismiss the application which will automatically destroy the attachment or (3) dismiss the application but specifically keep alive the attachment by an express order.\\r\\nThe rule, as amended, therefore, contemplates three distinct forms of order, any one of which may be made by the Court in the 585 circumstances mentioned in the rule.\\r\\nThe question before us is as to the category in which the order made on January 30, 1937, in Execution Case No. 118 of 1936 falls.\\r\\nIt will be recalled that the order of January 30, 1937, was made on a petition (Exhibit 2) filed on that day in Execution Case No. 118 of 1936.\\r\\nGreat stress was laid by the learned advocate for the appellants on the words \"struck off for the present\" occurring in the body of that petition.\\r\\nIt will be noticed that those words formed part of the request of the judgmentdebtor which was being recited in the petition.\\r\\nIn the actual prayer portion the decree holder did not use the words \"for the present\" but only asked the Court \"to strike off the execution case keeping the attachment in force.\\r\\n\" Further, apart from what the parties wanted, the Court made its intention clear in the very order that it passed and which is entered in column 20 of Exhibit F.\\r\\nThe Court regarded the willingness of the the decree holder to enter into a long and protracted negotiation with the judg ment debtor as evidence of unwillingness on the part of the decree holder to diligently prosecute the execution proceedings and accordingly dismissed the execution case for non prosecution but thought fit to expressly keep alive the attachment.\\r\\nIt is quite obvious that the Court made an order of the third kind mentioned above.\\r\\nThe three forms of order permissible under rule 57 as amended by the High Court are quite distinct and independent of each other and there is no room for their overlapping.\\r\\nIf the mere continuation of attachment will automatically convert an express order of dismissal of the execution application which is a final order into an order of adjournment which is not a final order then there was no point in the High Court taking the trouble of amending rule 57 at all.\\r\\nThe Court could by simply adjourning the proceedings automatically continue the attachment without any express direction in that behalf.\\r\\nThe fact that the Court gave an express direction that the attachment should continue clearly indicates that the 586 Court intended to make a final order of dismissal.\\r\\nAgain, the heading of column 20 in Exhibit F clearly indicates that only a final order is to be entered in that column.\\r\\nThe fact that the order was entered in that column affords some justification for the conclusion that the Court made a final order of dismissal.\\r\\nThat the claim case was automatically dropped is yet another indication that the execution case was at an end.\\r\\nThe fact that the judgment debtor had paid the full costs of the execution case is also a feature which goes to show, to a certain extent at any rate if not deci sively, that the execution proceeding was finally disposed of by the order.\\r\\nThe following endorsement appears on the petition exhibit 2 (a), dated June 2, 1939: \"Heard learned pleaders for the parties.\\r\\nThey jointly ask me to cancel the attachment (existing by special order) in Money exhibit 118 of 1936 though that case was dismissed.\" This endorsement also clearly shows that the Court itself understood that the order that it made on January 30; 1937, was a final order of dismissal and that the attachment had been continued by a special order.\\r\\nOn a consideration of all these matters I have not the least doubt in my mind that the order of January 30, 1937, was in form and in substance a final order of dismissal of the Execution Case No. 118 of 1936 and that the attachment was continued by a special order such as is contemplated and authorised by the amend ment made by the Calcutta High Court in rule 57.\\r\\nLearned advocate for the appellants contended that if the execution case came to an end the attachment could not be left hanging in the air.\\r\\nThere is no substance in this argument.\\r\\nOrdi narily, an attachment is supported by an execution case and if the execution case is simply dismissed the attachment must fail with it.\\r\\nBut rule 57, as amended, expressly empow ers the Court to dismiss an execution application but at the same time to keep alive the attachment by a special order.\\r\\nThat is what was done in this case.\\r\\nHere the attachment does not, to use the expression of the learned advocate for the appellants, 587 hang in the air.\\r\\nIt rests upon the solid foundation of a special order which rule 57, as amended, in terms authorises the Court to make.\\r\\nThe continuance of the attachment, in the circumstances, needs no execution proceeding to support it.\\r\\nTake the case of an attachment before judgment.\\r\\nUnder Order XXXVIII, rule 11, where after an order of attachment before judgment a decree is passed in favour of the plaintiff, it is not necessary upon an application for execution of such a decree to apply for re attachment of the property.\\r\\nIt means that the attachment continues and the judgmentdebtor cannot deal with the property to the disadvantage of the decree holder.\\r\\nAfter the decree is passed, the attachment continues but nobody will say that although there has been no applica tion for the execution of the decree at any time by the decree holder there is, nevertheless, an execution proceed ing pending merely because the attachment continues.\\r\\nHere also the attachment subsists and rests only upon the terms of Order, XXXVIII rule 11, and without any proceeding.\\r\\nSuch attachment cannot be called a proceeding in execution, for none was ever initiated after the decree was passed.\\r\\nIn my judgment, the order of January 30, 1937, was a final order which brought the Execution Case No. 118 of 1936, to an and and the attachment continued, not because there was a pend ing execution proceeding but because a special order was made under Order XXI, rule 57, as amended by the High Court.\\r\\nAs to (ii) Learned advocate for the appellants then contended that the petition (exhibit 2a) dated June 2, 1939, amounted to a proceeding in execution and as that was insti tuted and was pending after January 1, 1939 the proceedings came within the definition in section 2 (22)of \"a suit to which this Act applies\".\\r\\nI do not think this argument is sound.\\r\\nThe petition (Ex.2a) was not really an application at all.\\r\\nSee Raja Shri Prakash Singh vs The Allahabad Bank Ltd. (1).\\r\\nIn substance, it was nothing but a certification by the decree holder of the satisfaction of the decree.\\r\\nThe mere fact (1) 33 C.W.N. 267; A.I.R. 1929 P.C. 19, 588 that the document was in the form of a petition could not convert what was really the usual certifying procedure into a proceeding in execution for recovery of a loan or for enforcement of any agreement.\\r\\nIt was purely an intimation given to the Court by the decreeholder that the decree had been satisfied out of Court and the prayer for withdrawal of the attachment was merely consequential and would follow as a matter of course on full satisfaction of the decree being recorded.\\r\\nThe order made on that petition also shows that the decree was recorded as adjusted and the attachment was cancelled.\\r\\nIn my judgment, that petition (exhibit 2a) was not an application such as would initiate a proceeding in execution for any of the purposes mentioned in clauses (a) or (b) or (c) of section 2 (22) of the Act.\\r\\nFor reasons stated above, the decrees sought to be reopened were not decrees made in \"a suit to which this Act applies\".\\r\\nSuit No. 78 of 1922 was neither instituted on or after January 1, 1939, nor was it pending on that date, all the three decrees having been passed long before that date.\\r\\nNor was any proceeding in execution such as is contemplated by section 2 (22) instituted or pending on or after that date.\\r\\nThe Execution Case No. 118 of 1936 was at an end on January 30, 1937, and the petition of June 2, 1939, was not an application at all and was certainly not a proceeding in execution within the meaning of section 2 (22) of the Act.\\r\\nThis conclusion is sufficient to dismiss this appeal and it is not necessary for us to consider the other question raised by the respondent on the strength of section 36 (5) of the Act and I express no opinion on that question.\\r\\nThe result is that this appeal must stand dismissed with costs and I order accordingly.\\r\\nKANIA C.J. I agree.\\r\\nPATANJALI SASTRI J.\\r\\nThe facts bearing on the dispute in this appeal are fully stated in the judgment of ray brother Das which I have had the advantage of reading and it is unnecessary to recapitulate them here.\\r\\n589 The appellant mortgagor seeks in these proceedings the reliefs provided by the Bengal Money lenders Act, 1940 (hereinafter referred to as the Act) in respect of a decree debt payable by him.\\r\\nThe respondent who represents the sub mortgagee decree holder invokes the protection of two exemptions contained in the Act: (1) Section 86 (1), proviso (ii), which exempts inter alia \"any decree other than a decree in a suit to which this Act applies which was not fully satisfied by the first day of January, 1939\".\\r\\nThis raises a dispute as to whether the respondent \\'s decree was passed in a suit to which the Act applies.\\r\\n(2) Section 36 (5) which exempts \"the rights of any assignee or holder for value if the Court is satisfied that the assignment to him was bona fide and that he had not received the notice re ferred to in clause (a) of sub section (1) of section 28\".\\r\\nThis raises the question whether a sub mortgagee is an assignee within the meaning of the Act.\\r\\nOn the first question \"a suit to which this Act applies\" is defined in section 2 (22) as meaning \"any suit or pro ceeding instituted or filed on or after the 1st day of Janu ary, 1939, or pending on that date and includes a proceeding in execution for (among other things) the recovery of a loan advanced before or after the commencement of this Act.\\r\\n\" This definition has been construed as requiring that the \"pro ceeding in execution \"referred to therein should be pending on 1st January, 1939, and the question accordingly arises whether the order of the executing court dated 30th January, 1937, which purported to dismiss the respondent \\'s execution case for non prosecution while continuing the attachment already effected, terminated the proceeding in execution which had resulted in the attachment.\\r\\nIt was said that the order was made in accordance with Order XXI, rule 57, of the Civil Procedure Code as amended by the Calcutta High Court and must, therefore, be taken to have been intended to put an end to the execution proceeding altogether.\\r\\nI am not satisfied that such was the result of the dismissal.\\r\\nThe amendment which added the words \"unless the court shall make an order to the contrary\" 200 at the end of the rule envisages a dismissal of an \"applica tion for execution\" while at the same time continuing a subsisting attachment.\\r\\nThe dismissal of 30th January, 1987, must, therefore, be taken to be a dismissal of the execution application then before the court and cannot be taken to have any wider operation.\\r\\nOn the other hand, the continu ance, in express terms, of \\'the attachment notwithstanding the dismissal, indicates that the proceeding which had resulted in the attachment was kept alive to be carried forward later on by sale of the attached property.\\r\\nAttachment itself is a \"proceeding in execution\" and, so long.as it subsists, the proceeding in execution can well be regarded as pending.\\r\\nIn In re Clagett \\'s Estate; Fordham vs Clagett (1) Jessel M.R. declared that \"a pending matter in any court of justice means one in which some proceeding may still be taken\".\\r\\nThe attachment was cancelled by the court only on 2nd June, 1939, when the decree in question was recorded as adjusted and then, and not before, could execu tion of the decree be properly considered to have terminat ed.\\r\\nIn this view, a \"proceeding in execution\" was pending on the 1st day of January, 1939, and the respondent \\'s decree must be taken to have been passed \"in a suit to which this Act applies \\' \\', with the result that the respondent \\'s claim to exemption under proviso (ii) to sub section (1) of sec tion 36 of the Act must fail.\\r\\nI am, however, of opinion that the respondent \\'s claim to recover his decree debt is protected under section 36 (5).\\r\\nThere is no question here but that the submortgage to the respondent \\'s predecessor in title was bona fide.\\r\\nNor could he have received the notice referred to in clause (a) of \\' sub section (1) of section 28 as the transaction took place long before the Act was passed.\\r\\nIt is not disputed that section 36 (5) applies to pre Act debts.\\r\\n[See Renula Bose vs Manmatha Nath Bose(2)].\\r\\nThe only question, therefore, is whether the respondent as sub mortgagee is an assignee within the meaning of sub section (5) of section 36.\\r\\nThe learned (1) (2) L.R. 72 I.A. 156, 591 Judges in the court below held that he was not, following an earlier decision of their own court in Promode Kumar Roy vs Nikhil Bhusan Mukhopadhya(1).\\r\\nThat decision, however, was reversed by the Privy Council in Promode Kumar Roy vs Nikhil Bhusan Mukhopadhya(2) where their Lordships dealt with the question now before us in the following terms : \"It was suggested, in the judgment of Mitter J. (with which Waight J. agreed), and in the argument for the re spondents that if a sub mortgagee were an `assignee \\' within section 36, sub section (5), of the Act.\\r\\n, certain difficul ties and anomalies would result.\\r\\nTheir Lordships cannot agree with this suggestion.\\r\\nThey express no view as to the position which arises if the sub mortgage contains only a charge on the original mortgage debt, but when it contains an assignment of that debt, and of all the rights of the mortgagee, the position appears to be free from difficulty.\\r\\nRelief can be given to the original mortgagor as against the original mortgagee under section 36, but such relief must not affect the rights of the assignee by way of sub mort gage.\\r\\nTo take an imaginary case by way of illustration, let it be assumed that the amount due on the original mortgage, for principal and interest at the original rate, is Rs. 1,000, and the sum due on the sub mortgage by assignment, for principal and interest at the original rate, is Rs. 500.\\r\\nLet it further be assumed that if relief could be given, and were given, under section 36 as against both mortgagee and sub mortgagee, the sums due to them respectively would be Rs. 800 and Rs. 400.\\r\\nBy reason of sub section (5), the sub mortgagee \\'s rights cannot be affected.\\r\\nHe can therefore, as assignee of the mortgage debt: claim his full Rs. 500, as against both mortgagor and original mortgagee.\\r\\nBut if the court gives the mortgagor relief as against the original mortgagee, the mortgagor will only be liable to pay to the original mortgagee Rs. 300, the balance of the reduced debt after paying the sub mortgagee in full.\\r\\nAs to contention (b), it is impossible to read subsec tion (5) of section 36 as referring only to an assignee (1) (2) L.R. 76 I.A. 74.\\r\\n592 of a mortgage decree.\\r\\nThe words and that he had not received the notice referred to in clause (a)of subsection (1) of section 28 make it plain that an assignee of a mortgage debt is within the sub section, since section 28, sub section (1) is concerned only with assignment of debts\" (pp. 83 84).\\r\\nThe sub mortgage here in question also contains an assignment of the debt due under the original mortgage debt and of \"the entire interest\" of the original mortgagee.\\r\\nAfter reciting their original mortgage, the mortgagees proceed to state in the deed of sub mortgage: \"We mortgage all that is at present due and that will in future become due to us, the first, second, third and fourth parties, on account of the said one lakh of rupees together with interest and the entire interest under the mortgage taken by us on the basis of the said Indenture in respect of five annas share of the said Niskar Mouza Mono harbahal and in respect of sixteen annas of the surface and underground rights in the said Mouza Marichkota and we make over the said Deed of Indenture to you\".\\r\\nThe decision referred to above is, therefore, directly in point and rules the present case.\\r\\nIt was suggested that the said decision was inconsist ent with the earlier decisions of the same tribunal in Ram Kinkar Banerjee vs Satya Charan Srimani(1) and Jagadamba Loan Co. vs Raja Shiba Prasad Singh(2).\\r\\nStress was laid upon the expression \"all the rights of the mortgagee\" used by their Lordships in the passage quoted above, and it was pointed out that in the earlier decisions they held that in India a legal interest remained in the mortgagor even when the mortgage was in the form of an English mortgage, and that the interest taken by the mortgagee was not an absolute interest.\\r\\nThis proposition, it was said, implied that in a sub mortgage all the rights of the original mortgagee are not assigned to the sub mortgagee and that the mortgagee still retains a legal (1) 64 I.A. 50.\\r\\n(2) 68 I.A. 67.\\r\\n593 interest in the original mortgage.\\r\\nThis is a rather super ficial view of the matter.\\r\\nIn the earlier cases their Lordships were considering the quantum of interest trans ferred by a mortgagor to a mortgagee in a mortgage of leasehold interest for the purpose of determining whether or not there was privity of estate between the landlord and the mortgagee.\\r\\nIf the mortgage could operate as an assign ment of the entire interest of the mortgagor in the lease, the mortgagee would be liable by privity of estate for the burdens of the lease.\\r\\nIf on the other hand, it operated only as a partial assignment of the mortgagor \\'s interest, no such result would follow.\\r\\nIt was in determining that issue that their Lordships held that no privity of estate arose in India because a legal interest remained in the mortgagor and the interest taken by the mortgagee was not an absolute interest.\\r\\nThese cases had no bearing on the question, which arose in Promode Kumar Roy vs Nikhil Bhusan Mukhopadhya (1) and arises in the present case, as to whether a sub mortga gee becomes an assignee of the mortgage debt and of the mortgagee \\'s right to recover the debt from the original mortgagor.\\r\\nThe Act affords relief to certain classes of debtors by curtailing pro tanto the rights of the creditors, subject to certain exceptions in regard to \"assignments of loans\".\\r\\nIn such a context the only relevant consideration could be whether the assignment is such as to establish a debtor and creditor relation between the assignee and the debtor so as to bring the case within the purview of the Act.\\r\\nIf the sub mortgagee obtained, by virtue of the sub mortgage, the right to sue the original mortgagor for recov ery of the mortgage debt, that would seem sufficient to make him an assignee within the meaning of the Act.\\r\\nIt was from this point of view that the question as to the nature of the right transferred to a sub mortgagee under his sub mortgage was considered in Promode Kumar Roy vs Nikhil Bhusan Mukho padhya(1) as it has to be considered in the present case, and the reference to the sub mortgage containing an assign ment of all the rights (1) 76 I,A. 74.\\r\\n594 of the mortgagee must, in that context, be understood with reference to the sufficiency of the right assigned to enable the sub mortgagee to sue the original mortgagor in his own right, so as to bring the relevant provisions of the Act into play as between them.\\r\\nThe reservation made by their Lordships in the case of a sub mortgage containing only a charge on the original mortgage is significant and supports this view.\\r\\nI do not consider, therefore, that there is any inconsistency between Promode Kumar Roy vs Nikhil Bhusan Mukhopadhya(1) and the earlier decisions, and even if there be any such inconsistency it has no relevance to the present case.\\r\\nIn the result I agree that the appeal fails and should be dismissed with costs.\\r\\nAppeal dismissed.\\r\\n', {'entities': [[0, 28, 'CASE_NUMBER'], [79, 93, 'DATE'], [101, 137, 'COURT'], [139, 151,

G. Nargundkar, Excise Commissioner, Madhya Pradesh), and the appellant in Criminal Appeal No. 57 of 1951 (R.S. Patel) were tried in the court of Shri B.K. Chaudhri, Special Magistrate, Nag pur, for the offence of conspiracy to secure the contract of Seoni Distillery from April, 1947, to March 1951 by forging the tender, Exhibit P 3A, and for commission of the offences of forgery of the tender (Exhibit P 3A) and of another document, Exhibit P 24.\\r\\nThe learned Special Magistrate convicted both the appellants on all the three charges.\\r\\nHe sentenced R.S. Patel to rigorous imprisonment for one year under each charge and to pay fines of Rs. 2,000, Rs. 2,000, and Rs. 1,000, under the first, second and third charges respectively.\\r\\nThe appellant Nargundkar was sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for six months under each charge and to pay fines of Rs. 2,000, Rs. 2,000 and Rs. 1.,000, under the first, second and third charges respectively.\\r\\nEach of the appellants appealed against their respective convictions and sentences to the Court of the Sessions Judge, Nagpur.\\r\\nThe learned Sessions Judge quashed the conviction of both the appellants under the first charge of criminal conspiracy under section 120 B, I.P.C., but maintained the 1093 convictions and sentences under section 465, I.P.C. or the charges of forging Exhibits P 3 (A) and P 24.\\r\\nBoth the appellants went up in revision against this decision to the High Court but without any success.\\r\\nAn application was then made under article 136 of the Constitution of India for special leave to appeal and this was allowed by this Court on 24th March, 1950 The appellant, Nargundkar, is a member of the Central Provinces & Berar Provincial Service and held the substan tive post of Deputy Commissioner for several years.\\r\\nIn April, 1946, he was appointed Excise Commissioner.\\r\\nMadhya Pradesh, and continued to hold that office till the 5th September, \\'1947.\\r\\nThe appellant, R.S. Patel, is a sugar Technologist and Chemical Engineer.\\r\\nHe received his technical education and practical training in America and after working as Chief Chemist and General Manager in factories in Madras for five years, came to the Central Provinces in 1944, when the Provincial Government gave him a licence to set up a dis tillery for the manufacture of industrial spirit.\\r\\nOn the 11th September, 1946, Nargundkar in his capacity as Excise Commissioner invited tenders for working the Government distillery at Seoni and supplying spirit to certain specified districts f or a period of four years from 1st April, 1947, to 31st March, 1951.\\r\\nThe last date for submitting the tenders was the 31st October, 1946.\\r\\nIn response to this tender notice, five tenders were filed including those filed by (1) appellant, R.S. Patel, (2) K.B. Habibur Rahman, (3).\\r\\nZakirur Rahman, and (4) Edulji V. Doongaji (P. W. 4), in sealed covers with the Excise Commis sioner on the 31st October, 1946, and he handed them over with the seals intact to the office superintende.\\r\\nnt, S.W. Gadgil (P. w. 13), for safe custody.\\r\\nGadgil took them to his room and kept them under lock and key in the office safe.\\r\\nThe case for the prosecution is that on the 9th Novem ber, 1946, accused Nargundkar took these sealed tenders home, that the tenders were opened by him at his house, that the rates of the tender (Exhibit 1094 P 6) of E.J. Doongaji (P. W. 4) were divulged to accused 2 (R. section Patel), who was allowed to substitute another tender (Exhibit P 3A), containing rates lower than those of Doongaji, that thereafter these open tenders were brought to the office on the 11th November, 1946, and given to Amarnath (P.W. 20) who was the Assistant Commissioner of Excise, for submitting a report and that on the recommendation of Nar gundkar the tender of accused 2 (Patel) was accepted and the contract was given to him.\\r\\nIn May, 1947, on receipt of an application (Exhibit P 1) from one Dilbagrai (P. W. 14), enquiries were started by the Anti Corruption Department.\\r\\nBoth the accused became aware of the enquiry.\\r\\nIn order to create evidence in their favour they brought into existence a letter (Exhibit P 24) and antedated it to 20th November, 1946.\\r\\nThis document was forged with the intention of com mitting fraud and of causing injury to Amarnath (P. W. 20) and also to Doongaji (P.W. 4).\\r\\nExhibit P 24 is alleged to have been typed on a typewriter (Article A) which was pur chased on the 30th December, 1946, by the National Industri al Alcohol Co., Nagpur, of which accused Patel was the managing director.\\r\\nIt Was further alleged that the endorse ment made by accused 1 (Nargundkar) in the said letter \"No action seems necessary.\\r\\nFile\", and marked to Superintendent \"S\" was not made on the 21st November, 1946, which date it bears.\\r\\nThis letter was handed over by accused 1 to the Office Superintendent, S.W. Gadgil (P.W. 13) about the middle of August, 1947, and thereafter accused I wrote a letter (Exhibit P. 26), on the 2nd October, 1947, to Sri section Sanyal (P.W. 19) who was then the Excise Commissioner, requesting that this letter (Exhibit P 24) and a note sheet (Exhibit P 27) be kept in sale custody.\\r\\nBoth the accused denied the commission of the offences of criminal conspiracy, forgery and abetment thereof.\\r\\nNargundkar denied having attended office on the 9th Novem ber, 1946.\\r\\nHe denied having taken the tenders home.\\r\\nAc cording to him, the tenders were opened by him in the office on the 1095 11th November, 1946.\\r\\nAccused 2 denied that the tender of Doongaji was shown to him by accused 1 between the 9th and 11th November, 1946.\\r\\nHe stated that the tender (Exhibit P 3A) was the original tender submitted by him on the 31st October, 1946.\\r\\nAs regards Exhibit P 24, it was denied that it was fabricated or antedated.\\r\\nAccused 2 stated that it was not typed on article A.\\r\\nHe also alleged that the allegations made in Exhibit P 24 were correct.\\r\\nAccused Nargundkar stated that the endorsement was made by him on the 21st November, 1946.\\r\\nThe first charge having failed, nothing need be said about it herein.\\r\\nIn order to prove the second charge the prosecution had to establish that Gadgil, P.W. 13, handed over the sealed tenders on the 9th November, 1946, to accused Nargundkar, that the latter took them home, that between the 9th and the 11th November he met Patel at his house or elsewhere and that accused.\\r\\nNargundkar showed or communicated the particu lars of the tender of Doongaji to accused Patel who substi tuted Exhibit P 3A for his original tender before the 11th November, 1946.\\r\\nAdmittedly there is no direct evidence to prove any of these facts except the first one, and the nature of the case is such that recourse could only be had to circumstantial evidence to establish those facts.\\r\\nThe fact that the sealed tenders were handed over by Gadgil to accused Nargundkar on the 9th November has been held proved solely on the uncorroborated testimony of Gadgil as against the denial of Nargundkar.\\r\\nGadgil was himself a suspect in the case.\\r\\nHe was kept by the police away from the office for about eight months during the investigation, he was asked to proceed on leave at the instance of the police and his leave was extended at their request.\\r\\nOn the expiry of his leave he was kept off duty without salary for a period of about five months but later on he was paid his full salary after he had given evidence in support of the prosecution.\\r\\nHe made addi tions and improvements on vital points from stage to stage of his deposition and in certain particulars his statement was contradicted by Ramaswami, P.W. 80.\\r\\nOn his own admission he is an accomplice in respect 1096 of the forgery of Exhibit P 27, one of the documents al leged to have been forged for purposes of the defence but concerning which no prosecution was started.\\r\\nExhibit P 27 bears date 31st October, 1946.\\r\\nGadgil \\'s statement about it is as follows: \"He (Nargundkar) put down his signature and the date 31st October, 1946.\\r\\nThis order was actually written by Sh.\\r\\nNargundkar in the note sheet, Exhibit P 27, in the month of July or August, 1947.\\r\\nThe dates were antedated.\\r\\nIn the margin of the note sheet I have put down my initials S.W.G. and put the date 31st October, 1946.\\r\\nThis note sheet was not prepared on gist October, 1946.\\r\\nHe asked me to keep it in my custody.\\r\\n\" The witness admittedly became a party to the preparation of a forged document.\\r\\nWhether he was telling the truth, or he was telling a lie, as appears likely from his cross examination, he is in either event, not a person on whom any reliance could be placed.\\r\\nIt is curious that this aspect of the evidence of Gadgil has not been noticed by any of the three courts below.\\r\\nWhen the court of first instance and the court of appeal arrive at concurrent findings of fact after believing the evidence of a witness, this court as the final court does not disturb such findings, save in most exceptional cases.\\r\\nBut where a finding of fact is arrived at on the testimony of a witness of the character of Gadgil and the courts below depart from the rule of prudence that such testimony should not be accepted unless it is corroborated by some other evidence on the record, a finding of that character in the circumstances of a particular case may well be reviewed even on special leave if the other circumstances in the ease require it, and substantial and grave injustice has result ed.\\r\\nAfter fully examining the material on the record we have reached the conclusion that the courts below were in error in accepting the uncorroborated testimony of Gadgil to find the fact that he handed over the tenders to Nargund kar on the 9th November, 1946.\\r\\nThe witness was not allowed to live in a free atmosphere and was kept under police 1097 surveillance during the whole of the period of investigation and the trial and was rewarded with payment of his full salary after he had given evidence to the satisfaction of the prosecution.\\r\\nHe is a person who felt no hesitation in deposing on oath that he willingly became a party to the forgery of Exhibit 13 27.\\r\\nAssuming that the accused Nargundkar had taken the tenders to his house, the prosecution, in order to bring the guilt home to the accused, has yet to prove the other facts referred to above.\\r\\nNo direct \\' evidence was adduced in proof of those facts.\\r\\nReliance was placed by the prosecution and by the courts below on certain circumstances, and intrinsic evidence contained in the impugned document, Exhibit P 3A.\\r\\nIn dealing with circumstantial evidence the rules specially applicable to such evidence must be borne in mind.\\r\\nIn such cases there is always the danger that conjecture or suspi cion may take the place of legal proof and therefore it is right to recall the warning addressed by Baron Alderson to the jury in Reg vs Hodge (1) where he said : \"The mind was apt to take a pleasure in adapting circum stances to one another, and even in straining them a little, if need be, to force them to form parts of one connected whole; and the more ingenious the mind of the individual, the more likely was it, considering such matters, to over reach and mislead itself, to supply some little link that \\'is wanting, to take for granted some fact consistent with its previous theories and necessary to render them complete.\\r\\n\" It is well to remember that in cases where the evidence is of a circumstantial nature,the circumstances from which the conclusion of guilt is to be drawn should in the first instance be fully established, and all the facts so estab lished should be consistent only with the hypothesis of the guilt of the accused.\\r\\nAgain, the circumstances should be of a conclusive nature and tendency and they should be such as to exclude every hypothesis but the one proposed to be proved.\\r\\nIn (1) 141 1098 other words, there must be a chain of evidence so far com plete as not to leave any reasonable ground for a conclusion consistent with the innocence of the accused and it must be such as to show that within all human probability the act must have been done by the accused.\\r\\nIn spite of the force ful arguments addressed to us by the learned Advocate Gener al on behalf of the State we have not been able to discover any such evidence either intrinsic within Exhibit P 3A or ,outside and we are constrained to observe that the courts below have just fallen into the error against which warning was uttered by Baron Alderson in the above mentioned case.\\r\\nThe trial magistrate was of the opinion that friendship between the two accused was of a very rapid growth and that their relations were very intimate and accused 2 was in a position to influence accused 1.\\r\\nHe thus found that there was motive for the commission of the crime.\\r\\nThe learned Sessions Judge disagreed with this finding and the High Court agreed with the Sessions Judge on this point.\\r\\nIt observed that the evidence which tended to prove friendship or undue favour was not such as to form the basis for a finding.\\r\\nIt further found that there was nothing to show that the appellant Nargundkar received any illegal reward or the promise of one for showing Doongaji \\'s tender to accused R.S. Patel.\\r\\nThe first circumstance therefore on which the trial Judge placed considerable reliance was negatived by the court of appeal and in revision.\\r\\nIt having been found that there was no motive whatsoever for accused Nargundkar to show the tenders to accused Patel and to take a substi tuted tender from him, the main link in the chain of reason ing of the trial court vanishes.\\r\\nAmiable relations between the two accused or their official relationship could not be regarded as sufficient motive for committing the crime of forgery.\\r\\nThe mainstay of the prosecution case is the intrinsic evidence of the contents of Exhibit P 3A itself which ac cording to the courts below are unusual, peculiar and strange and which according to the Advocate General could not be there if it was a genune 1099 document.\\r\\nThe argument would have force provided the prem ises on which it is based are correct.\\r\\nHaving examined the contents of Exhibit P 3A, we do not find anything very unusual or extraordinary in it which could not be there without its author having seen Exhibit P 6.\\r\\nWe now proceed to examine the so called peculiar features in Exhibit P 3A.\\r\\nIn order to appreciate the points made by the learned Advocate General it is necessary to set out certain facts.\\r\\nExhibit P 9 is the notice calling for tenders for the supply of country spirit in the Seoni distillery area.\\r\\nThe rates which were called for by this notice were as follows: 1.\\r\\nFlat rate for four years.\\r\\nRates on sliding scale for four years.\\r\\nAll in rate on the sliding scale for one year 1947 48. 4.\\r\\nFlat rates on the basis of the price of mahua flowers for three years 1948 51. 5.\\r\\nAll in sliding scale rate on the basis of the price of mahua flowers for three years 1948 51.\\r\\nThe trial magistrate held on a construction of it that no rate or rates of separate years were asked for in this notice and that one flat rate was only asked for, for four years.\\r\\nHabibur Rahman and Zakirur Rahman in their tenders, Exhibits P 4 and P 5, quoted one flat rate for four years and did not mention separate flat rates for separate years.\\r\\nDoongaji in his tender, Exhibit P 6, mentioned separate flat rates for each separate year also.\\r\\nHe did so because he consulted one Mr. Munshi, Personal Assistant to the Excise Commissioner, whether he should quote each rate separately and Mr. Munshi told him that he could give flat rate for the combined years as well as flat rates and also sliding scale rates for each year separately.\\r\\nAdmittedly accused 2 was working as an agent of Habibur Rahman and his son Zakirur Rahman for the distillery contracts of Betul and Seoni, and, therefore, he must have been the author not only of his own tender but of the tenders submitted by Habibur Rahman and Zakirur Rahman, Exhibits 1100 P 4 and P 5.\\r\\nAll of them were acting together with the object of getting the contract though they were submitting three separate tenders.\\r\\nThe trial magistrate held that as Habibur Rahman and Zakirur Rahman gave one flat rate for four years as called for by Exhibit P 9, but accused 2, the author of all these tenders, did not do it in Exhibit P 3A, but followed the method of Doongaji in giving the rates of each year separately as well as the rate for the combined four years.\\r\\nlie must have done so as he was shown the tender Exhibit P section The question arises whether the circumstance that the accused Patel and Habibur Rahrnan and Zakirur Rahman were acting together was such from which a necessary inference arises that the accused Patel must have been the author of all the three tenders and, if he were, that he could not have departed from the method adopted by him in preparing Exhibits P 4 and P 5 unless and until he had seen Exhibit P 6.\\r\\nWe are clearly of the opinion that from the premises stated this inference does not necessarily follow.\\r\\nDoongaji even after reading Exhibit P 9, could not make up his mind whether to submit the tender with one flat rate for all the four years or whether to submit it by giving sepa rate flat rates for each of the four years and made enquiry from the office of the Excise Commissioner and then quoted separate rates for each of the four years separately also.\\r\\nPatel who has admittedly considerable experience of distill ery contracts and about the method of submitting tenders might very well have thought that it was best to quote a flat rate for all the years as well as a flat rate for each year separately.\\r\\nThe circumstance that he did not do so in the other two tenders prepared by him does not materially advance the prosecution case.\\r\\nThe very object of submitting several tenders on behalf of three persons acting in unison was to indicate to the excise authorities that they were being submitted by three different persons.\\r\\nIf there were no variations whatsoever between those tenders that would have defeated the very purpose of submitting them.\\r\\nMore over, a variation of this trifling nature between Exhibits P 3A and P 4 1101 and P 5 cannot be said to be of such an unusual or of such an extraordinary character as to warrant the inference that it could not have been made except without a look at the tender of Doongaji.\\r\\nThe circumstance is of a neutral charac ter and the trial magistrate and the learned Sessions Judge gave undue importance to it, being obsessed with the idea that such a quotation of flat rates for each year could not be mentioned in a tender by a contractor merely on a con struction of Exhibit P 9 and without any further inquiry or without seeing the tender of somebody else who had followed that method.\\r\\nThe next circumstance on which considerable reliance is placed is that accused 2 studiously maintained rates below the rates of Doongaji throughout, that when Doongaji lowered his rates for the second year accused 2 did the same, and when Doongaji raised his rates for the third and fourth years accused 2 also did so, at the same time maintaining rates lower than Doongaji \\'s rates.\\r\\nIt is said that the system followed by Habibur Rahman and Zakirur Rahman and Patel originally must have been the same as Patel was the author of all the three tenders, that Habibur Rahman \\'srates were higher than Zakirur Rahman \\'s by six pies and this variation was constant throughout, that in Patel \\'s original tender which must have followed the same system his rates would be lower than Habibur Rahman \\'s by three pies through out.\\r\\nExhibit P 3A, however, shows that this is not so.\\r\\nPatel abandoned the system when he found that his rates on his original scheme would be higher than the correspond ing rates of Doongaji.\\r\\nLearned Advocate General contended that it was impossible for Patel unless he had seen Exhibit P 6, to quote rates of a large number of items numbering about 197, in every case lower than the rates given in Exhibit P 6 and the circumstance that in not a single case he has quoted a higher rate than Exhibit P 6 is conclusive of the fact that he had done so after he had seen Exhibit P 6.\\r\\nIt was also said that there is no satisfactory explana tion why Patel abandoned the scheme adopted by him in 1102 drawing up Exhibits P 4 and P 5 and his original tender.\\r\\nIn our view, this circumstance again is not so strange or peculiar as was made out by the learned Advocate General or in the courts below.\\r\\nIn the first place, there is no material whatsoever for the assumption that the so called original tender was drawn up on the same scheme as Exhibits P 4 and P 5 or that there was a constant variation in rates between it and Habibur Rahman \\'s tender.\\r\\nIt has been assumed on mere surmise that the first five rates in the tender, Exhibit P 3A, are the rates that had been originally quoted.\\r\\nThe original tender is not forthcoming and there is no evidence at all about its contents.\\r\\nMoreover, in the depo sition of Doongaji it was elicited that in the year 1942 when tenders for the Seoni distillery contract were called for, the rates quoted by Ratanshah were lower than his rates for all items.\\r\\nHe, however, voluntarily added that Ratanshah obtained his rates of the previous contracts before he submitted his tender for the year 1942 and that he had made a reduction of annas two to three in those rates but he was forced to admit that the rate of Ratanshah in the tender was not only lower than his but was also lower throughout than the rates of Laxminarain, Haji Ismail and Habibur Rahman even without seeing their tenders.\\r\\nFrom this statement it is quite clear that even without seeing the tenders of differ ent tenderers a contractor may quote rock bottom rates of all items on his own calculation or impelled by the desire of taking the contract anyhow.\\r\\nWe do not follow why Patel could not do in 1946 what was done by Ratanshah in his tenders in 1942 and quote rates lower in all particulars and regarding all items than the rates of Doongaji.\\r\\nIf a person is out to give rockbottom rates and his calculation is such that his rates work out lower than the rates of others, it may well be that he may quote lower rates in respect of all items.\\r\\nIt was then said that Patel had adopted a particular plan in submitting the three tenders, of himself, Habibur Rahman and Zakirur Rahman and that his plan was that his rates should be less by three pies 1103 than the rates he had quoted for Habibur Rahman, that in the first five items of Exhibit 145 he stuck to that plan and did not alter the rates of those items as originally submit ted by him, as those rates were lower than the rates of Doongaji but from the sixth item onwards he substituted new rates for the ones he had originally submitted and he de parted from the plan so that his rates for each item were to be lower only by three pies as compared with the rates of Habibur Rahman.\\r\\nIt is no doubt true that Patel did not adhere to the plan that he adopted in the first five items of his tender but is that a circumstance from which any inference can be drawn that the first five items are a part of his original tender or that he did so depart from them because he had seen Exhibit P 6 and he wanted to underbid Doongaji.\\r\\nAs we have already said, the object of submitting three separate tenders ostensibly by persons who were acting together was to secure the contract in one or the other name and Patel who was the author of all the three documents may very well in his own document have quoted much lower figures than were quoted by Habibur Rahman and Zakirur Rahman, in order also to give the impression that all these tenders had not been submitted by one and the same person.\\r\\nBe that as it may, a closer examination of the tenders of Doongaji and Patel completely negatives the theory of the courts below.\\r\\nThe rates quoted in the first five items of Exhibit P 145 are lower than the rates of Doongaji by 102, 69, 18, 12 and 9 pies respectively.\\r\\nEven in the subsequent quotations except in one case where the disparity in the tales of Doongaji and Patel is only two pies, the disparity in the rates is from 9 to 11 pies.\\r\\nPatel is certainly a businessman and the whole object of quoting the rates was to earn the maximum profit.\\r\\nIf he had seen the tender of Doongaji he would have modelled the rates in a manner that would give him the highest profit.\\r\\nThe learned Advocate General could not suggest any reason whatsoever why Patel would maintain his quotation for the quantity of 50,000 gallons at Rs, 2 10 6 when the rate of Doongaji was Rs. 3 3 0 1104 He could easily raise the quotation to Rs. 3 and similarly in all other cases he could have underbid Doongaji by 2, 3 or 6 pies at the most.\\r\\nHe need not have maintained a dis parity of 9 to 11 pies between his rates and the rates of Doongaji.\\r\\nIn our opinion, therefore, no conclusion of any character could be drawn from the disparity in the rates of Doongaji or of Patel or of the expected uniformity in the rates of Habibur Rahman or of R.S. Patel which would estab lish that Exhibit P 3A had been prepared by having a look at Exhibit P 6.\\r\\nAnother circumstance on which reliance was placed was that certain rates in Exhibit P 3A are lower than the corre sponding rates in Exhibit P 6 by only one or two pies.\\r\\nThere is no doubt that one or two rates are lower by two pies than the rates in Exhibit P 6 but nothing follows from that innocent circumstance, unless one starts with a pre sumption of guilt.\\r\\nOnce it is assumed that the tender of Doongaji was shown to Patel, all these circumstances might to some extent fit in with the view that in certain respects it may have been copied from Exhibit P 6.\\r\\nThe courts below fell into this error and departed from the rule that in a criminal case an accused person is to be presumed to be innocent and that it is for the prosecution to establish his guilt conclusively.\\r\\nNext it was urged that in the covering letter Exhibit P 3 sent by Patel he mentions three appendices numbered 1, 2 and 3, The same expression finds place in the covering letter Exhibit P 4 of Habibur Rahman and Exhibit P~5 of Zakirur Rahman, that appendices 1 to a of the tender of Habibur Rahman and Zakirur Rahman correctly answer to the reference in the covering letters but this is not so in Patel \\'s case; on the other hand, instead of appendix 1, Patel has appendix 1 (a) and 1 (b) and the number of his appendices thus goes up to four and this departure from Exhibits P 4 and P 5 came about because of his having seen Exhibit P 6 and the number of appendices annexed to it.\\r\\nIt was urged that the original tender of Patel must have contained three appendices like those of Habibur Rahman and 1105 Zakirur Rahman and not appendix l(a) and l(b) as now found and that this circumstance showed substitution of the \\'tender.\\r\\nThe learned magistrate, in our opinion, in giving importance to this circumstance mislead himself completely.\\r\\nIn the first place, it is not accurate to say that the expression appendices 1, 2 and 3 was common to the covering letters Exhibts P 4 and P 5.\\r\\nIn Exhibit P 5 the appen dices are marked A, B and C. Therefore, no uniform method was adopted by Patel in marking the appendices to the ten ders, Exhibits P 4 and P 5.\\r\\nSecondly, there is no conflict in the expression of the appendices of Habibur Rahman and Patel.\\r\\nThey have been marked as 1, 2 and 3 and a mere subdi vision of the first appendix into (a) and (b) could not be taken to be a departure from the method adopted in the description of the appendices.\\r\\nIt may further be observed that the covering letter signed by Patel mentions four appendices, while the covering letters of Habibur and Zaki rur Rahman only mention three appendices.\\r\\nThe trial magis trate as well as the Sessions Judge ignored all these dif ferences in the method of the description of the appendices and assumed that they had been uniformly described.\\r\\nThe result therefore is that all these so called peculiar features found by the courts below in Exhibit P 3A should be eliminated from consideration and it must be held that there are really no circumstances inconsistent with Exhibit P 3A being a genuine document.\\r\\nIt could have been made out without looking at Exhibit P 6.\\r\\nIn this view of the case the whole basis on which the judgments of the courts below are founded vanishes, and in the absence of any evidence of motive, we are of the opinion that the facts did not on any just or legal view of them warrant a conviction, and al though the proceedings are taken to have been unobjection able in form, justice has gravely and injuriously miscar ried.\\r\\nWe therefore set aside the conviction of both the appellants on the second charge and acquit them, 142 1106 In order to appreciate the third charge, it is necessary to set out the terms of Exhibit P 24 which it is said was antedated in order to create evidence for the defence of the accused and to injure Amarnath.\\r\\nIt is in these terms: Congress Nagar, Nagpur, 20th November, 1946.\\r\\nThe Commissioner of Excise, C.P. & Berar, Nagpur.\\r\\nDear Sir, I beg to submit few of my complaints for such action as you may be pleased to take, which are as under.\\r\\nI went to see Mr. Amarnath last week, at his residence in connection with Seoni Distillery work.\\r\\nI saw Mr. Edulji and his partner with Mr. Amarnath in the office room of his residence with some office files.\\r\\nFrom the papers I could recognize my tender open on the table in front of them.\\r\\nAs soon as I went there, all of them were astonished and they could not speak with me for a moment, and then they carried on some dry general conversation with me.\\r\\nSame way after about a week, when I went to Seoni for mahua bill, when Mr. Amarnath visited for sanctioning the advance, I had the opportunity to see Mr. Amarnath in dak bungalow at about 9 30 p.m. when I saw Mr. Mehta the ex manager of Mr. Edulji (who is also the manager of Seoni Electric Co.) with Mr. Amarnath near table with the same file of the tender.\\r\\nNo doubt after seeing the above two incidents I requested Mr. Amarnath to be fair in this af fair.\\r\\nI am bringing these incidents to your notice, as I fear that something underhand may not be going on, and I am afraid that my tender may be tampered with.\\r\\nHoping to get justice, Yours faithfully, Sd.\\r\\nR.S. Patel.\\r\\n\" 1107 The words \"Congress Nagar, Nagpur, 20th November, 1946\" are in manuscript, while the rest of the letter has been typed.\\r\\nThe digit 6 of the year 1946 has been over written on digit 7 written in continental style and it is apparent to the naked eye that originally the writer wrote 7 and subsequently changed it to 6.\\r\\nIt was contended by the learned Advocate General, and this is the finding of the courts below, that this letter was written some time during the investigation of the case in July or August 1947, and was antedated in order to implicate Amarnath and to use it as evidence in defence.\\r\\nThe point for decision is wheth er there is any evidence whatsoever to establish this act.\\r\\nWe have not been able to discover any such evidence on the record; on the other hand the intrinsic evidence in the letter proves that most likely it came into existence on the date it bears.\\r\\nThe relevant facts are that the tenders were opened by accused Nargundkar on the 11th November, 1946, he handed them over after making the endorsements to Amarnath and Amarnath had to submit a report about them.\\r\\nIt is alleged in this letter that \"last week\", i.e., during the week commencing on the 11th November, 1946, accused Patel went to see Amarnath and there he saw Edulji Doongaji with him with his tender open on his table in front of him and that he was astonished at it, that about a week later he again went to Seoni and had the opportunity to see Amarnath and Mr. Mehta, ex manager of Edulji Doongaji, was with him and the tender file was lying there.\\r\\nIt was stated that he had requested Amarnath to be fair in this affair and the Commissioner was asked that he should see that his tender was not tampered with and he got justice.\\r\\nThe whole purpose and object of this letter was to protect himself against any underhand dealing in the granting of the contract.\\r\\nIn his statement under section 342, Cr. P.C., Patel said that he saw Amarnath on the morning of the 15th or 16th November, 1946, and he met Amarnath at Seoni at the distillery prem ises on the 16th November, 1946, and on the same 1108 day he met him at about 9 p.m. at the Seoni dak bungalow and that he again met him on the 17th November, at 10 a.m.\\r\\nHe also stated that he had gone to see Amarnath at his resi dence at Nagpur between the dates 12th and 18th November.\\r\\nIt was contended by the learned Advocate General that his statement was inconsistent with the recitals contained in Exhibit P 24.\\r\\nWe see nothing inconsistent between this statement and the recitals.\\r\\nIf accused Patel saw Amarnath on the 12th, the letter having been written on the 20th November, it would be quite a correct thing to say that he saw him \"last week\" and the next recital when he said that about a week thereafter he saw him again is quite consistent with his going and seeing him on the 16th or 17th November.\\r\\nThat would be about a week after the first visit.\\r\\nTo draw any conclusion adverse to the accused from a slight inaccu racy in the description of dates and to conclude therefrom that it was established that the accused Patel had seen Amarnath on the 9th November, 1946, amounts to unnecessari ly stretching a point against the accused.\\r\\nThe recitals in the letter, true or false, are quite consistent with the letter bearing date 20th November, 1946.\\r\\nThe magistrate observed that the vagueness about the date and the week shows that the allegations therein are not correct.\\r\\nWe have not been able to understand how the vagueness about the date could lead to the conclusion arrived at.\\r\\nEmphasis was laid on the overwriting of the figure 6 over the figure 7 in the manuscript part of the letter.\\r\\nIt was said that the normal experience is that it becomes a subconscious habit to automatically write the year correctly when several months have elapsed after the change of the year and that by sheer force of habit the correct year must have been put down when the date was entered in the letter Exhibit P 24 and that the figure was subsequently changed to 6 and this fact was an indication that the letter was written some time in the year 1947.\\r\\nIn our view this argument again involves an element 1109 of conjecture.\\r\\nThe mistake may well have been inadvertent ly made and the correction made there and then.\\r\\nThat such mistakes are not very uncommon or unusual and occur in official documents is fully established on the record, in para 93 of the judgment of the learned Sessions Judge and it is said as follows: \"The appellants have produced a file which is Exhibit ID 35.\\r\\nIt contains a sheet which bears pages 9 and 10.\\r\\nOn the 10th page there are two office notes one is written by A.M. Naidu and the other by the appellant Nargundkar.\\r\\nA.M. Naidu below his signature has written \\'6 4 1948 \\'.\\r\\nThe appellant Nargundkar below his signature has written \\'6 4 1947 \\'.\\r\\nThe other notes in the office file show that the correct date of the two signatures was 6th August, 1947.\\r\\nThus in this sheet there are two mistakes in mentioning the number of the month and one mistake in mentioning the number of the year.\\r\\nThe appellants contend that such mistakes are possible.\\r\\nNobody can deny that such mistakes are possible; but it has to be decided what inferences can be drawn from such mistakes, if there is other evidence also.\\r\\n\" We have looked in vain for other evidence to prove that the letter was not written on \\'the date it bears.\\r\\nEven Gadgil could not explain why he said that the letter was written in July, 1946.\\r\\nIt is clear that he is not telling the \\' truth in this respect.\\r\\nThe endorsement made on the letter by accused Nargundkar clearly bears the date 21st November, 1946, and if this letter was not given to him on the date of the endorsement and was given to him several months afterwards he would in ordinary course have made some note either on the letter or in the receipt register of his office when that letter was received by him.\\r\\nThen it was said that this letter was not in the file of the tenders which were kept separate.\\r\\nThe Commissioner had noted that the letter be filed and he sent it to the office.\\r\\nIf the office people did not put it in the file, from that circum stance no adverse inference could 1110 be drawn as to the date that the letter bears.\\r\\nIt is dear that no forger would have in such a clumsy manner corrected 1947 into 1946 so as to leave the original figure \"7\" intact and thus leave evidence of its suspicious character writ large on its face.\\r\\nThere was no hurry about it, and a second letter without the alteration could easily have been typed.\\r\\nNext it was argued that the letter was not typed on the office typewriter that was in those days, viz., article B, and that it had been typed on the typewriter article A which did not reach Nagpur till the end of 1946.\\r\\nOn this point evidence of certain experts was led.\\r\\nThe High Court rightly held that opinion of such experts was not admissible under the Indian Evidence Act as they did not fall within the ambit of section 45 of the Act.\\r\\nThis view of the High Court was not contested before us.\\r\\nIt is curious that the learned Judge in the High Court, though he held that the evidence of the experts was inadmissible, proceeded nevertheless to discuss it and placed some reliance on it.\\r\\nThe trial magis trate and the learned Sessions Judge used this evidence to arrive at the finding that, as the letter was typed on article A which had not reached Nagpur till the end of December, 1946, obviously the letter was antedated.\\r\\nTheir conclusion based on inadmissible evidence has therefore to be ignored.\\r\\nIt was further held that the evidence of experts was corroborated by the statements of the accused recorded under section 342.\\r\\nThe accused Patel, when questioned about this letter, made the following statement: \"Exhibit P 31 was typed on the office typewriter article B. Exhibit P 24 being my personal complaint letter was typed by my Personal Assistant on one of the typewriters which were brought in the same office for trial, with a view to purchase.\\r\\nAs this was my personal complaint no copy of it was kept in the Correspondence Files Exhibit P 34 and Exhib it P 35 just 1111 as there is no copy in these files of my tender Exhibit P 3A . . .\\r\\nIn the month of September, October and November, 194t5, several machines were brought for trial from various parties in our of rice till the typewrit er article A was purchased by National Industrial Alcohol Ltd. Company.\\r\\n\" If the evidence of the experts is eliminated, there is no material for holding that Exhibit P 24 was typed on article A.\\r\\nThe trial magistrate and the learned Sessions Judge used part of the statement of the accused for arriving at the conclusion that the letter not having been typed on article B must necessarily have been typed on article A.\\r\\nSuch use of the statement of the accused was wholly unwar ranted.\\r\\nIt is settled law that an admission made by a person whether amounting to a confession or not cannot be split up and part of it used against him.\\r\\nAn admission must be used either as a whole or not at all.\\r\\nIf the statement of the accused is used as a whole, it completely demolishes the prosecution case and, if it is not used at all, then there remains no material on the record from which any inference could be drawn that the letter was not writeen on the date it bears.\\r\\nFor the reasons given above we hold that there is no evidence whatsoever on the record to prove that this letter Exhibit P 24 was antedated and that being so, the charge in respect of forgery of this letter also fails.\\r\\nRead as a whole, this letter cannot be said to have been written with the intention of causing any injury to Amarnath or for the purpose of creating a defence in respect of the second charge.\\r\\nThe letter read as a whole is an innocuous document and its dominant purpose and intent was to safeguard the interests of accused Patel and to protect him against any underhand or unfair act of his rival contractors.\\r\\nWe cannot infer any intent to defraud or any intention to injure Amarnath, though in order to protect himself accused Patel made certain allegations against him.\\r\\nWe therefore set aside the conviction of both the appellants under the third charge and acquit them.\\r\\n1112 The result is that the consolidated appeal is allowed, the judgments of all the three courts below are set aside and the appellants are acquitted.\\r\\nAppellants acquitted.\\r\\nAgent for the appellant in Criminal Appeal No. 56 of 1951: Ganpat Rai.\\r\\nAgent for the appellant in Criminal Appeal No. S7 of 1951: Rajinder

Ramdas, Amritsar District, that with a view to prevent ing him from acting in a manner prejudicial to the security of the State, it is necessary to make the following order: Now, therefore.\\r\\nin exercise of the powers conferred by sub section (1) of section 3 and section 4 of the Preven tive Detention Act, 1950, as amended by the Preventive Detention (Amendment) Act, 1951, the Governor of Punjab hereby directs that the said Naranjan Singh Nathawan be committed to the custody of the Inspector General of Pris ons, Punjab, and detained in any jail of the State till 31st March, 1952, subject to such conditions as to maintenance, discipline and punishment for breaches of discipline as have been specified by general order or as contained in the Punjab Detenu Rules, 1950.\\r\\n\" This order was served on the petitioner on 23rd May, 1951, but no grounds in support of this order were served on him.\\r\\nThe petitioner thereupon presented this petition for his release contending that the aforesaid order was illegal inasmuch as (1) the grounds of detention communicated to him on 10th July, 1950, were \"quite vague, false and imaginary\" and (2) he was not furnished with the grounds on which the order dated 17th May, 1951, was based.\\r\\nThe petition was heard ex parte on 12th November, 1951, when this Court issued a rule nisi calling upon the respondent to show cause why the petitioner should not be released, and it was posted for final hearing on 23rd November, 1951.\\r\\nMeanwhile, the State Government issued an order on 18th November, 1951.\\r\\nrevoking the order of detention dated 17th May, 1951, and on the same date the District Magistrate, Amritsar, issued yet another order for the detention of the petitioner under sections a and 4 of the amended Act; this last order along with the grounds on which it was based was served on the petitioner on 19th November, 1951.\\r\\nThereupon the petitioner submitted a supplemental peti tion to this Court on 28th November, 1951, challenging the validity of the last order on the ground 398 that \"it was only a device to defeat the habeas corpus petition of the petitioner in which a rule had already been issued , and he put forward an additional ground of attack on the legality of the earlier order dated 17th may, 1951, namely, that it fixed the term of detention till 31st March, 1952, before obtaining the opinion of the Advisory Board as required by section 11 of the amended Act.\\r\\nThis ground was evidently based on the view expressed by this Court that the specification of the period of detention in the initial order of detention under section 3 of the amended Act before obtaining the opinion of the Advisory Board rendered the order illegal.\\r\\nIn the return to the rule showing cause filed on behalf of the respondent, the Under Secretary (Home) to the Govern ment explained the circumstances which led to the issue of the fresh order of detention dated 18th November, 1951.\\r\\nAfter stating that the petitioner \\'s case was referred to and considered by the Advisory Board constituted under section 8 of the amended Act and that the Board reported on 30th May, 1951, that there was sufficient cause for the detention of the petitioner, the affidavit proceeded as follows: \"That the Government was advised that the orders made under section 11 of the , as amended by the Preventive Detention (Amendment) Act, 1951, but carried out in the form of orders under section 3 of the said Act, should be followed by grounds of detention and, as this had not been done in most cases, the detentions were likely to be called in question.\\r\\nThe Government was further advised there were other technical defects which might render the detention of various detenus untenable.\\r\\nIn view of this, the Government decided that the cases of all dete nus should be reviewed by the District Magistrates con cerned.\\r\\nAccordingly, the Punjab Government instructed the District Magistrates to review the cases and apply their minds afresh and emphasised that there must exist rational grounds with the detaining authority to justify the deten tion of a person and they were asked to report clearly in each case if the District 399 Magistrate concerned wanted the detenus to be detained.\\r\\nThe Punjab Government also reviewed some cases.\\r\\nAccordingly all cases including the case of the petitioner were reviewed and in this case the District Magistrate was again satisfied that it was necessary that the detenu be detained with a view to prevent him from acting in a manner prejudicial to the security of the State and the maintenance of public order.\" And it concluded by stating \"that the petitioner is detained now under the orders of the District Magistrate, Amritsar.\\r\\n\" The original and supplementary petitions came on in due course for hearing before Fazl Ali and Vivian Bose JJ.\\r\\non 17th December, 1951, when reliance was placed on behalf of t he petitioner on certain observations in an unreported decision of this Court in Petition No. 334 of 1951 (Naranjan Singh vs The State of Punjab) and it was claimed that in view of those observations and of the provisions of Part III of the Constitution, the decision in Basant Chandra Ghose vs King Emperor(1), on which the respondent relied.\\r\\nwas no longer good law.\\r\\nThe learned Judges thought that the matter should be considered by a Constitution bench and the case was accordingly placed before us.\\r\\nIt will be seen from the affidavit filed on behalf of the respondent that the case of the petitioner, along with his representation against the detention order of 17th May, 1951, was placed before the Advisory Board for its consider ation, and the Board reported on 30th May, 1951, that in its opinion there was sufficient cause for the detention of the petitioner.\\r\\nIt is said that, on the basis of that report, the Government decided that the petitioner should be de tained till 31st March, 1952, but while a properly framed order under section 11 should \"confirm\" the detention order and \"continue\" the detention for a specified period, the order of 17th May, 1951, was issued under a misapprehension in the form of an initial order under section 3 of the amended Act.\\r\\non the same grounds as before without any fresh communication thereof to the petitioner.\\r\\nTo (1) 52 400 avoid arguments based on possible defects of a technical and formal character, the said order was revoked under section 13, and on a review of the case by the District Magistrate, a fresh order of detention was issued under section 3 on 18th November, 1951, and this was followed by a formal communication of the same grounds as before as there could be no fresh grounds, the petitioner having throughout been under detention.\\r\\nIt is contended by the Advocate General of the Punjab that the decision reported in is clear authority in support of the validity of the aforesaid order.\\r\\nOn essentially similar facts the court laid down two propo sitions both of which have application here.\\r\\n(1) Where an earlier order of detention is defective merely on formal grounds, there is nothing to preclude a proper order of detention being based on the pre existing grounds them selves, especially in cases in which the sufficiency of the grounds is not examinable by the courts, and (2) if at any time before the court directs the release of the detenu, a valid order directing his detention is produced, the court cannot direct his release merely on the ground that at some prior stage there was no valid cause for detention.\\r\\nThe question is not whether the later order validates the earli er detention but whether in the face of the later valid order the court can direct the release of the petitioner.\\r\\nThe learned Judges point out that the analogy of civil proceedings in which the rights of parties have ordinarily to be ascertained as on the date of the institution of the proceedings has no application to proceedings in the nature of habeas corpus where the court is concerned solely with the question whether the applicant is being lawfully de tained or not.\\r\\nThe petitioner \\'s learned counsel conceded that he could not challenge the correctness of the second proposition, but took exception to the first as being no longer tenable after the Indian Constitution came into force.\\r\\nIt was urged that article 22 lays down the procedure to be followed in cases of preventive detention and the said procedure must be strictly observed 401 as the only prospect of release by a court must be on the basis of technical or formal defects, a long line of deci sions having held that the scope of judicial review in matters of preventive detention is practically limited to an enquiry as to whether there has been strict compliance with the requirements of the law.\\r\\nThis is undoubtedly true and this Court had occasion in the recent case of Makhan Singh Tarsikka vs The State of Punjab (Petition No. 308 of 1951)(1) to observe \"it cannot too often be emphasised that before a person is deprived of his personal liberty the procedure established by law must be strictly followed and must not be departed from to the disadvantage of the person affected\".\\r\\nThis proposition, however, applied with equal force to cases of preventive detention before the commence ment of the Constitution, and it is difficult to see what difference the Constitution makes in regard to the position.\\r\\nIndeed, the position is now made more clear by the express provisions of section 13 of the Act which provides that a detention order may at any time be revoked or modified and that such revocation shall not bar the making of a fresh detention order under section 3 against the same person.\\r\\nOnce it is conceded that in habeas corpus proceedings the court is to have regard to the legality or otherwise of the detention at the time of the return and not with reference to the date of the institution of the proceeding, it is difficult to hold, in the absence of proof of bad faith, that the detaining authority cannot supersede an earlier order of detention challenged as illegal and make a fresh order wherever possible which is free from defects and duly complies with the requirements of the law in that behalf.\\r\\nAs regards the observations in Naranjan Singh \\'s case, we do not understand them as laying down any general proposi tion to the effect that no fresh order of detention could be made when once a petition challenging the validity of an earlier order has been filed in court.\\r\\nThe learned Judges appear to have inferred from the facts of that case that the later order was (1) Since reported as ; 402 not made bona fide on being satisfied that the petitioner \\'s detention was still necessary but it was \"obviously to defeat the present petition\".\\r\\nThe question of bad faith, if raised would certainly have to be decided with reference to the circumstances of each case, but the observations in one case cannot be regarded as a precedent in dealing with other cases.\\r\\nWe accordingly remit the case for further hearing.\\r\\nThis order will govern the other petitions where the same ques tion was raised.\\r\\nPetitions remitted.\\r\\n', {'entities': [[94, 104, 'PROVISION'], [208, 221,

Mitter or S.C. Mitter, having been and being still the Managing Agents of the said Mills have undertaken to reimburse the said Mills in respect of the decrees to be made in the said four suits in the manner hereinafter appearing NOW THESE PRESENTS WITNESS AND IT IS HEREBY AGREED AND DECLARED (i) That out of the commission of 3% payable by the said Mills to the said Agency under Regulation 131 of the Arti cles of Association of the Company, the Company shall have paramount lien on and deduct and set off a moiety thereof against any payment which the said Mills may make in respect of the decrees or any of them and/or costs of the said suits.\\r\\n(ii) The said moiety shall be one half of the commis sion so payable less such sum as the Directors of the Mills may from time to time allow to be deducted.\\r\\n\" Under the said agreement, the respondent company paid to the Mill Company Rs. 22,500made up of 1012 Rs. 18,107 as principal and Rs. 4,393 as interest in the accounting year.\\r\\nThe assessee company claimed this before the Income tax Appellate Tribunal as a deduction permitted under section 10 (2) (xv) of the Indian Income tax Act.\\r\\nThe relevant part of that section runs as follows : \"10.\\r\\n(1) \"The tax shall be payable by an assessee under the head \\'Profits and gains of business, profession or vocation \\' in respect of the profits or gains of any busi ness, profession or vocation carried on by him \\' (2) Such profits or gains shall be computed after making the following allowances, namely : (xv) any expenditure (not being in the nature of capital expenditure or personal expenses of the assessee) laid out or expended wholly and exclusively for the purpose of such business, profession or vocation.\\r\\nIn the statement of the case submitted by the Tribunal after reciting the fact of the incorporation of the company and the terms of the compromise mentioned above, the argu ments urged on behalf of the assessee company have been recapitulated.\\r\\nThe first argument was that under the first proviso to section 7 of the Indian Income tax Act, this payment was liable to be exempted.\\r\\nThe Tribunal rejected that argument.\\r\\nOn the reference, the High Court also reject ed the same and it was not presented before us.\\r\\nThe next argument of the respondents was that in respect of Rs. 22,500 it was entitled to exemption under section 10(2) (xv) of the Income tax Act on the ground that the payment was an expenditure which was not in the nature of a capital expend iture or personal expenses of the applicant company but was an expenditure laid out wholly and exclusively for the purpose of its business.\\r\\nThey urged that if the applicant company did not agree to pay this amount, Basanti Cotton Mills Ltd. could have brought a suit against the company to realise this amount due on the hundis which would 1013 have exposed the applicant company to the public and in order to save themselves from the scandal and maintain the managing agency they agreed to \\'the deduction of of certain amounts from the managing agency commission due to it and thereby brought it within the principles of the decision of Mitchell vs\\r\\nB.W. Noble Ltd.(1) The Tribunal found as facts: (1) \\'I?hat the applicant company agreed to pay off the decretal amount from the remuneration which they are enti tled to get from the Basanti Cotton Mills.\\r\\n(2) The decree was passed against the applicant company evidently for certain misfeasance committed by its directors and the applicant company agreed to pay it off from its remunera tion.\\r\\n(3) The books of account of Basanti Cotton Mills Ltd. would show that they were paying the applicant company in full its remuneration and the books of the applicant company also show that it was entitled to its remuneration in full.\\r\\n(4) In the circumstances the Tribunal held that the expendi ture was not laid out wholly and exclusively for the purpose of carrying on the business.\\r\\n(5) Besides, the Tribunal was of the opinion that in this case it was not a revenue ex penditure at all.\\r\\nAs the payment had to be made towards liquidation of the decretal amount the Tribunal held, in the circumstances of this case, that it was a capital payment.\\r\\nOn behalf of the respondent it was argued in the further alternative that the Privy Council decision in Raja Bijoy Singh Dudhuria \\'s case(2) would cover the present case.\\r\\nThat contention was rejected by the Tribunal.\\r\\nThis statement of the case prepared by the Incometax Tribunal and submitted to the High Court for its opinion was perused by the parties and they had no suggestions to make in respect of the same.\\r\\nThe statement of the case was thus settled with the knowledge and approval of the parties.\\r\\nWhen the matter came before the High Court, Mr. Mitra, who argued the case for the present respondents, as shown by the judgment of the High Court, urged as follows: \" If the applicant company had not agreed to pay the amount mentioned ; 1014 in the aforesaid agreement, then the Basanti Cotton Mills Ltd. would have sued the company for the realisation of the amounts due on the hundis and it seems that there would have been no defence to the action.\\r\\nThis would have subjected the applicant company to the danger of public exposure and in order to save itself from the scandal and in order to main tain the managing agency, the applicant company agreed to deduct certain amounts from the managing agency commission and therefore such expenditure came within section 10(2)(xv) of the Act.\" The High Court thereafter noticed several cases including Mitchell \\'s case(1) and towards the close of the judgment delivered by Chatterjea J. observed as follows: \"In this case it is clear that the agreement was entered into with a view to avoid the publicity of an action against the managing agents and consequent exposure and scandal andin order to maintain the managing agency so that the company could carry on its business as before.\\r\\nThe payment in question did not bring in any new assets into existence nor in my opinion can it properly be said that it brought into existence an advantage for the enduring benefit of the company \\'s trade.\\r\\nThe Appellate Tribunal observed that the decree was evidently passed against the appellant compa ny forcertain misfeasance by its directors and the appellant company agreed to pay it off from its remuneration .\\r\\nThe object of the agreement was to enable the company to remove a defect in carrying on the business of the company and to earn profits in its business.\\r\\nTherefore this case is covered by the judgment of the Court of Appeal in Mitchell \\' scase(1) . \"Applying this line of reasoning the High Court differed from the conclusion of the Tribunal and allowed the deduction to the respondent company under sec tion 10(2) (xv) of the Income tax Act, as claimed by the respondents.\\r\\nThe Commissioner of Income tax, West Bengal, has come in appeal to us.\\r\\nNow it is clear that this being a claim for exemption of an amount, contended to be an expenditure falling under section 10(2)(xv), the burden of proving the (1) ; 1015 necessary facts in that connection was on the assessee, it being common ground that the commission was due and had become payable and was therefore the business income of the assessee company liable to be taxed in the assessment year.\\r\\nThe jurisdiction of the High Court in the matter of income tax references is an advisory jurisdiction and under the Act the decision of the Tribunal on facts is final, unless it can be successfully assailed on the ground that there was no evidence for the conclusions on facts recorded by the Tribu nal.\\r\\nIt is therefore the duty of the High Court to start by looking at the facts found by the Tribunal and answer the questions of law on that footing.\\r\\nAny departure from this rule of law will convert the High Court into a fact finding authority, which it is not under the advisory jurisdiction.\\r\\nThe statement of the case under the rules framed under the Income tax Act is prepared with the knowledge of the parties concerned and they have a full opportunity to apply for any addition or deletion from that statement of the case.\\r\\nIf they approved of that statement that is the agreed statement of facts by the parties on which the High Court has to pronounce its judgment.\\r\\nIn the present case the parties perused the statement of case and as disclosed by the note made at the end of it had no suggestions to make in respect thereof.\\r\\nIt is therefore clear that it was the duty of the High Court to start with that statement of the case as the final statement of facts.\\r\\nSurprisingly, we find that the High Court, in its judgment, has taken the argument of Mr. Mitra as if they were facts and have based their conclusion solely on that argument.\\r\\nNowhere in the statement of the case prepared by the Tribunal and filed in the High Court, the Tribunal had come to the conclusion that the payment was made by the assessee company to avoid any danger of public exposure or to save itself from scandal or in order to maintain the managing agency of the appellant company.\\r\\nThe whole conclusion of the High Court is based on this unwar ranted assumption of facts which are taken only from the argument of counsel for the present respondents before 1016 the High Court.\\r\\nThe danger of failing to recognise that the jurisdiction of the High Court in these matters is only advisory and the conclusions of the Tribunal on facts are the conclusions on which the High Court is to exercise such advisory jurisdiction is illustrated by this case.\\r\\nIt seems that unfortunately counsel for the respondents caught hold of Mitchell \\'s case(1) and basing his argument on the circum stances under which a payment could be described as a busi ness expenditure falling within the terms of section 10 (2) (xv), argued that the facts in the present case were the same.\\r\\nInstead of first ascertaining what were the facts found by the Tribunal in the present case, the process was reversed and the procedure adopted was to take Mitchell \\'s case(1) as the law and argue that the facts in the present case covered the situation.\\r\\n1n our opinion this is an entirely wrong approach and should not have been permitted by the High Court.\\r\\nThe High Court fell into a grave error in omitting first to ascertain what were the facts found in the case stated by the Tribunal.\\r\\nThe High Court overlooked that in Mitchell \\'s case(1) the whole discussion started with a quotation from the case stated by the Commissioners as the facts of the case.\\r\\nA scrutiny of the record in the present case shows that before the Income tax Officer the assessees claimed only a deduction of the interest of Rs. 5,582 as a permissible deduction under section 10 (2) (iii) of the Income tax Act.\\r\\nThat claim was rejected by the Income tax Officer.\\r\\nWhen the matter went to the Assistant Income tax Commissioner it was argued that the Income tax Officer was in error in not allowing the deduction of interest and was also wrong in not allowing the entire sum of Rs. 22,500 as a deduction on the ground that portion of the income (viz., Rs. 22,500) should be treated as not earned or deemed to be earned by the assessees at all, having regard to the decision of the Privy Council in Raja Bijoy Singh Dudhuria \\'s case(2) The first paragraph of the order of the Appellate Assistant Commis sioner contains the following 1017 statement : \" In disallowing this (interest) c]aim the Income tax Officer was following the decision of my prede cessor in his order dated the 18th March 1942 in Appeal No. 1 C 11 of 1941 42.\\r\\nMy predecessor observed: \"Nothing is in evidence to show that the managing agency company had sur plus money and such money was invested or that there was any need to borrow.\\r\\nThus the need to borrow is not established.\\r\\nThere is no doubt that money was borrowed but unless it can to proved that the borrowing is for the purpose of the business and the loan was used in the business, the interest cannot be allowed under section 10(2)(iii).\\r\\n\" The second objection raised before the Appellate Assist ant Commissioner was in these terms : \" That the Income tax Officer should have allowed the said sum of Rs. 22,500 as allowable expenditure being allocation of a sum out of the revenue receipt before it became income in the hands of the assessee.\\r\\n\" The wording of the objection and the argument noticed in the order of the Appellate Assistant Commissioner show that the contention was that this sum should be treated as not having become the income of the assessee at all because it was deducted at the source by the Mill company.\\r\\nReliance was placed for this contention on Raja Bijoy Singh Dudhuria \\'s case(1).\\r\\nThe contention was rejected.\\r\\nAt the third stage, when the assessee urged his contentions before the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal, he thought of urging as an argument that this was a permissible deduction under section 10 (2)(xv) because of the principles laid down in Mitchell \\'s case(2).\\r\\nNo evidence, it appears, was led before the Income Tax Tribunal, nor has the Tribunal recorded any findings of fact on which the principles laid down in Mitch ell \\'s case(2) could be applied.\\r\\nThe Tribunal \\'s conclusions of facts were only as summarized in the earlier part of the judgment.\\r\\nIt is therefore clear that the necessary facts required to be established before the principles laid down in MiZchell \\'s case( \\'2) could be applied, have not been found as facts in the present case at any stage of the proceedings and the High Court was in error (1) (2) ; 130 1018 in applying the principles of Mitchell \\'s case(1) on the assumption of facts which were not proved.\\r\\nThe High Court was carried away, it seems, by the argument of the coun sel and through error accepted the argument as facts.\\r\\nIndeed, if it had noticed the contention urged before the Income tax Officer it would have seen at once that the argument was in a measure conflicting with that contention which was based on the footing of Rs. 1,80,000 being a loan to the assessee on which it had to pay interest, which was sought to be deducted under section 10 (2) (iii) of the Income tax Act.\\r\\nIn our opinion, therefore, this appeal should be allowed on the simple ground that the facts neces sary to be established by the respondents to support their claim for exemption under section 10(2)(xv)of the Indian Income tax Act have not been established at any stage of the proceedings and therefore they are not entitled to the deduction claimed.\\r\\nThe appeal is therefore allowed with costs here and before the High Court.\\r\\n', {'entities': [[0, 22, 'CASE_NUMBER'], [54, 90, 'COURT'], [92, 104, 'JUDGE'], [109, 119, 'JUDGE'], [130, 149, 'DATE'], [172, 186,

Isaacs (section N. Mukherjee, with him), for the appel lant.\\r\\nThe respondent was not represented.\\r\\nApril 10.\\r\\nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered by MUKHERJEA J.\\r\\nThis appeal is directed against a judgment of a Division Bench of the Madras High Court dated 1st April, 1949, passed in a certiorari proceeding, by which the learned Judges directed the issue of a writ of certiorari for quashing a portion of an order made by the Labour Com missioner, Madras, in any enquiry under section 51 of the Madras Shops and Establishments Act.\\r\\n520 The facts material for our present purpose lie within a narrow compass and to appreciate the point that requires consideration in this appeal it will be convenient first of all to advert to a few relevant provisions of the Madras Act referred to above.\\r\\nThe Act was passed in 1947 and its ob ject, as stated in the preamble, is to provide for the regulation of conditions of work in shops and other estab lishments.\\r\\nSection 14(1) of the Act sets a statutory limi tation upon the working hours and lays down: \"Subject to the other provisions of the Act, no person employed in any establishment shall be required or allowed to work for more than 8 hours in any day and 48 hours in any week.\\r\\n\" A proviso attached to the sub section which by way of exception to the rule enunciated therein, allows employment of a person in any establishment for any period in excess of this statutory limit subject to payment of overtime wages, provided the period of work including overtime work does not exceed 10 hours any day, and in the aggregate 54 hours in any week.\\r\\nSection 31 provides: \"Where any person employed in any establishment is re quired to work overtime, he shall be entitled, in respect of such overtime work, to wages at twice the rate of ordinary rate of wages.\\r\\n\" Section 50 preserves the existing rights and privileges of an employee in any establishment if these rights and privileges are more favourable to him than those created by the Act.\\r\\nThe section runs as follows : \"Nothing contained in this Act shall affect any rights or privileges which any person employed in any establishment is entitled to on the date on which this Act comes into operation in respect of such establishment under any other law, contract, custom.\\r\\nOr Usage applicable to such estab lishment if such rights and privileges are more favourable to him than those to which he would be entitled under this Act.\\r\\n\" 521 The only other relevant section is section 51 which says : \"If any question arises whether all or any of the provi sions of this Act apply to an establishment or to a person employed thereto or whether section 50 applies to any case or not, it shall be decided by the Commissioner of Labour and his decision thereon shall be final and shall not be liable to be questioned in a court of law\".\\r\\nThe appellant is a limited company carrying on business in Madras, while the respondent is an association of cleri cal employees including those working under the appellant.\\r\\nOn November 10, 1948, the respondent presented an applica tion before the Labour Commissioner, Madras, under section 51 of the Shops and Establishments Act for decision of certain questions referred to in the petition which related to the rights and privileges of the employees of the appel lant.\\r\\nThe Commissioner issued a notice calling upon the appellant to appear and answer the contentions raised on behalf of the employees.\\r\\nThe parties appeared before the Commissioner on 26th November, 1948, and again on 16th December following when they were represented by lawyers.\\r\\nAfter hearing the parties and on a consideration of the evidence adduced by them, the Labour Commissioner made his decision on 29th January, 1949.\\r\\nThe questions raised by the employees were classified by the Commissioner under six separate issues and two of them, which are material for our present purpose, are worded as follows : Issue No. 5.\\r\\nWhether there has been an increase in working hours from 6 to 61/2 on week days from 12th October, 1948, and the increase is permissible ? Issue No. 6.\\r\\nWhether overtime wages at twice the ordi nary rates should not be paid for work done by the employees after the normal working hours ? On Issue No. 5.\\r\\nthe \\'decision of the Commissioner was that the \\'business hours of the company were six and half prior to 1st April, 1948 \\', when the Act came into force and they continue to be so even now.\\r\\nIt is 522 true that a circular \\' was issued which was to take effect from 12th October, 1948, under which the lunch interval was reduced by half an hour, but at the same time it was direct ed that the office would close for business with the general public at 5 P.M. instead of 5 30 P.M.\\r\\nOn all working days so far as business hours are concerned.\\r\\nAs regards Issue No. 6 the Labour Commissioner observes first of all that although it is customary in many estab lishments to fix certain hours of business during which business is transacted with the outside public, yet they are not the \\'real hours of employment and as a matter of fact the employees do work outside these business hours, for which they are not entitled to any extra remuneration pro vided.\\r\\nthe statutory limit of 8 hours a day is not exceeded.\\r\\nIn the opinion of the Commissioner if the normal hours of work were previously fixed and strictly adhered to, the employees could have acquired a right or privilege to work only for such hours and they would be entitled to seek protection under section 50 of the Act against the imposi tion of longer hours without a corresponding increase in emoluments.\\r\\nThe Commissioner goes on to say that in such cases it would be sufficient if compensatory wages are paid at the ordinary rate calculated according to rule 10 of the Madras Shops and Establishments Rules for work in excess of the normal hours but less than the statutory hours.\\r\\nBut for work of more than 8 hours a day or 48 hours a week, wages at twice the ordinary rates should be paid as required by the proviso to section 14 (1) and section 31 of the Act.\\r\\nThe conclusion reached by the Commissioner with regard to this issue is expressed by him in the following words: \"I hold that the case of Messrs. Parry and Company \\'s employees falls under the former category and that the employees in this company will be entitled to overtime wages only when the statutory hours are exceeded.\\r\\n\" This order, as said above, was made on 29th January, 1949, and on 16th of February following the 523 respondent association filed a petition before the High Court at Madras, praying for a writ of certiorari to quash the same.\\r\\nThis application was heard by a Bench of two Judges and by the judgment dated 1st of April, 1949, the learned Judges allowed the petition in part and quashed the order of the Labour Commissioner in so far as it decided that the employees of the appellant will be entitled to overtime wages only when the statutory hours were exceeded.\\r\\nIt is the/propriety of this decision that has been chal lenged before us in this appeal.\\r\\nIt is somewhat unfortunate that the respondent remained unrepresented before us and the appeal had to be heard ex parte.\\r\\nMr. Isaacs, who appeared on behalf of the appellant, has, however, rendered every assistance that he possibly could and has placed before us all the material facts and relevant provisions of law.\\r\\nHaving given the matter our best consideration, we are of the opinion that the order of the High Court cannot be supported and that this appeal should be allowed.\\r\\nThe High Court seems to have based its decision on the ground that the Commissioner of Labour \\' failed to answer the question raised by the association as to whether the company was entitled to require the employees to work more than six and half hours a day.\\r\\nAccording to the learned Judge, the Labour Commissioner was not right in holding that even if the working hours were fixed at six and half hours a day, the employees would be entitled to overtime wages only when the statutory hours are exceeded.\\r\\nAs has been pointed out already, the Labour Commission er did decide that if the normal hours of work were previ ously fixed and rigidly adhered to, the employees would be entitled to seek protection under Section 50 of the Act against imposition of longer hours of ,work without a corre sponding increase in their emoluments.\\r\\nThe increase in such cases, according to the Labour Commissioner, should be on the scale of compensatory wages allowed under rule 10 of 524 the Madras Shops and Establishments Rules.\\r\\nIf, however, the increase is more than the statutory period, \"the employees will be entitled to wages at double rate under Section 31 of,the Act.\\r\\nThis decision may or may not be right, but it has not been and cannot be suggested that the Labour Commis sioner acted without jurisdiction or in excess of his pow ers.\\r\\nUnder Section 51 of the Madras Shops and Establish ments Act, the Labour Commissioner is the only proper and competent authority to determine the questions referred to it in that section; and there is an express provision in it that the decision of the Labour Commissioner shall be final and not liable to be challenged in any court of/law.\\r\\nIt was the respondent who took the matter before the Labour Commis sioner in the present case and invited his decision upon the questions raised in the petition.\\r\\nThe Commissioner was certainly bound to decide the questions and he did decide them.\\r\\nAt the worst, he may have come to an erroneous conclu sion, but the conclusion is in respect of a matter which lies entirely within the jurisdiction of the Labour Commis sioner to decide and it does not relate to anything collat eral, an erroneous decision upon which might affect his jurisdiction.\\r\\nThe records of the case do not disclose any error apparent on the face of the proceeding or any irregu larity in the procedure adopted by the Labour Commissioner which goes contrary to the principles of natural justice.\\r\\nThus there was absolutely no grounds here which would justi fy a superior court in issuing a writ of certiorari for removal of an order or proceeding of an inferior tribunal vested with powers to exercise judicial or quasi judicial functions.\\r\\nWhat the High Court has done really is to exer cise the powers of an appellate court and correct what it considered to be an error in the decision of the Labour Commissioner.\\r\\nThis obviously it cannot do.\\r\\nThe position might have been different if the Labour Commissioner had omitted to decide a matter which he was bound to decide and in such cases a mandamus might legitimately issue commanding the authority to determine questions which it left 525 undecided(1); but no certiorari is available to quash a decision passed with jurisdiction by an inferior tribunal on the mere ground that such decision is erroneous.\\r\\nThe judg ment of the High Court, therefore, in our opinion, is plain ly unsustainable.\\r\\nIn the view which we have taken, it is unnecessary to express any opinion as to whether certiorari has been taken away if it can be taken away at all under our Constitution by the provision of section 51 of the Madras Shops and Establishments Act which lays down that the decision of the Labour Commissioner would be final and incapable of being challenged in any court of law.\\r\\nIt was conceded by Mr. Isaacs that in spite of such statutory provisions the superior court is not absolutely deprived of the power to issue a writ, although it can do so only on the ground of either a manifest defect of jurisdiction in the tribunal that made the order or of a manifest fraud in the party procuring it(2).\\r\\nThe result is, that in our opinion the appeal succeeds and the judgment of the High Court is set aside and the order of the Labour Commissioner affirmed.\\r\\nAs the respondent was absent, we do not think it proper, in the circumstances of this case, to make any order for costs.\\r\\n(1) Vide Board of Education vs Rice and others, [1911] A.C. 179.\\r\\n(2) Vide Colonial Bank of Australasia vs Robert Willan, 5P.C.

Agarwal, with him) for the appellant.\\r\\nSom Nath Chopra for the respondent.\\r\\nFebruary 25.\\r\\nThe Judgment of the court was deliv ered by FAZL ALI J.\\r\\nThis is an appeal by special leave against the judgment of the Punjab High Court upholding the decision of a Subordinate Judge of Delhi relating to a petition filed by the appellant company under section 33 of the Indian Arbitration Act against the respondents, 503 The material facts are these.\\r\\nOn the 22nd April, 1947, the appellant company insured a car belonging to the first respondent and issued a policy which fully sets out the terms and conditions of the agreement relating to the insur ance.\\r\\nThe first respondent left his car in a garage at Lahore and came away to India on the 31st July, 1947.\\r\\nSubsequently, he learned about the loss of his car, and sent a legal notice dated the 18th March, 1948, through his advocate Mr. A.R. Kapur to the Head Office of the company at Calcutta, claiming a sum of Rs. 7,000 for the loss of the car.\\r\\nOn the 10th April, 1948, Mr. Kapur received a letter from the Branch Manager of the Company \\'s office at Amrit sar asking for information regarding certain matters stated in the letter.\\r\\nThis information appears to have been sup plied on the 30th April, 1948.\\r\\nOn the 26th May, 1948, the company \\'s Branch Manager at Amritsar wrote to the first respondent repudiating the liability of the company for the loss of the car on the ground that the loss was \"due to communal riots which were going on in the whole of Punjab\" and was not covered by the agreement of insurance.\\r\\nA simi lar letter was written again by the Branch Manager on the 3rd July, 1948, to the first respondent, and another letter was written by one Mr. Rattan Lal Chawla representing him self to be counsel for the company, to Mr. A.R. Kapur, on the 1st August, 1948.\\r\\nOn the 21st November, 1949, the first respondent wrote a letter to the Branch Secretary of the Company \\'s office at Calcutta, stating that his claim was valid and nominating Mr. T.C. Chopra, Assistant Manager, Lakshmi Insurance Company Ltd., Delhi, as arbitrator on his behalf and requesting the company to appoint another person as arbitrator on its behalf.\\r\\nThereafter, the company pre sented an application on the 29th December, 1949, in the court of the Senior Sub judge, Delhi, under section 33 of the Indian Arbitration Act, against the first respondent and Mr. T.C. Chopra, the arbitrator, who is the second respond ent in this appeal, praying for 504 (1) a declaration to the effect that the reference to arbitration and the appointment of respondent No. 2 as sole arbitrator was illegal; (2) a declaration to the effect that if the respondent No. 2 made any award it would not be binding on the company;and (3) an injunction restraining the respondents Nos. 1 and 2 from taking any proceeding in the matter and the respond ent No. 2 from making any award.\\r\\nUpon this petition, notice was issued to the respond ents, and an injunction was issued directing them not to file any award till the date of the next hearing, which was fixed for 31st January, 1950.\\r\\nOn the 4th February, 1930, the first respondent wrote to the second respondent (the arbitrator) that since no arbitrator had been appointed by the company and since the company had refused to appoint any arbitrator, he (Mr. Chopra) was to act as the sole arbitra tor.\\r\\nOn the 6th February, 1950, Mr. Chopra wrote to inform the insurance company that he had been appointed sole arbi trator and asked the company to send the statement of its case and to produce all the evidence on the 14th February, 1950.\\r\\nOn the 10th February, 1950, the insurance company filed a petition before the Subordinate Judge, Delhi, pray ing that the respondents be stopped from proceeding further in the matter so that its application under section 33 may not become infructuous.\\r\\nOn the 11th February, the Subordi nate Judge issued notice to the respondents fixing the 17th February as the date of hearing and passed the following order: \"Moreover (till) the decision of this application the arbitrator should not give or pronounce his award but should continue the proceedings.\\r\\n\" On the 14th February, 1950, the second respondent pronounced his award after making a note to the following effect: \" Mr. G.R. Chopra, the counsel of the defendants, sent a telephonic message at 12 A.M. requesting extension till 1 P.M.\\r\\nI agreed and accordingly I waited for 505 him and the plaintiff with his counsel also waited up to 1 P.M.\\r\\nNobody turned up on behalf of the defendants.\\r\\nI commenced the proceedings and took the statement of the plaintiff and the documents that he had produced.\" He made a further note at the end of the award to this effect : \"As after the giving of the award a notice was served upon me not to give the award, I have not sent any formal letter to the parties informing them of the award and its costs.\\r\\n\" On the 24th March, 1950, the Subordinate Judge passed an order on the company \\'s application under section 33, dis missing it and holding that the terms of clause 7 of the agreement \"were comprehensive enough to include the points of disputes between the parties now and as such are triable by the arbitrator and not by the court.\\r\\n\" The Subordinate Judge concluded his order by observing: \"I, therefore, hold that the reference to the arbitra tion of the differences is perfectly valid and the points raised by the parties to this application with regard to the abandonment of claim and its becoming irrecoverable are to be decided by the arbitrator.\\r\\n\" The judgment of the Subordinate Judge was upheld in revision by the Punjab High Court and the company has now preferred an appeal to this court by special leave.\\r\\nThe points that were urged on behalf of the appellant in this appeal are these: (1) that the arbitration clause had ceased to be opera tive and the question as to the existence and validity of the arbitration agreement was triable by the court under section 33 of the Arbitration Act and not by the arbitrator; and (2) that the award was invalid and not binding on the appellant, because it was pronounced in spite of the order of the court dated the 11th February, 1950, directing the arbitrator not to pronounce his award.\\r\\n506 Clause 7 of the policy of insurance rims as follows : \"All differences arising out of this policy shall be referred to the decision of an arbitrator to be appointed in writing by the parties in difference or if they cannot agree upon a single arbitrator to the decision of two arbi trators one to be appointed in writing by each of the parties within one calendar month after having been required in writing so to do by either of the parties or in case the arbitrators do not agree of an umpire appointed in writing by the arbitrators before entering upon the reference.\\r\\nThe umpire shall sit with the arbitrators and preside at their meeting and the making of an award shall be a condition precedent to any right of action against the company.\\r\\nif the company shall disclaim liability to the insured for any claim hereunder and such claim shall not within twelve calendar months from the date of such disclaimer have been referred to arbitration under the provisions herein con tained then the claim shall for all purposes be deemed to have been abandoned and shall not thereafter be recoverable hereunder.\\r\\n\" It will be noticed that this clause provides among other things that if the company disclaimed liability to the insured for any claim under the policy and such claim was not within twelve calender months from the date of such disclaimer referred to arbitration, then the claim should be deemed to have been abandoned and was not recoverable.\\r\\nThe case of the company is that it disclaimed liability for the loss of the car on three successive occasions, namely, on the 26th May, 1948, the 3rd July, 1948, and the 1st August, 1948.\\r\\nThe first respondent however did not take any action in regard to the appointment of an arbitrator until the 21st November, 1949, i.e, until more than 12 months after even the last disclaimer by the company.\\r\\nFor this reason, the claim put forward by the first respondent must be deemed to have been abandoned and he cannot recover anything from the company.\\r\\nOn the other hand.\\r\\nthe case of the first respond ent, which 507 is set out in.\\r\\nhis affidavit dated the 17th February, 1950, is that there was never any valid disclaimer by the company of its liability.\\r\\nThe position that he took up was that the Branch Manager of the company had no authority to disclaim the liability, and it could have been disclaimed only by a resolution of the company.\\r\\nNow these being the respective contentions of the parties, the question is whether the point in dispute fell to be decided by the arbitrator or by the court under section 33 of the Arbitration Act.\\r\\nSection 33 is to the following effect: \"Any party to an arbitration agreement or any person claiming under him desiring to challenge the existence or validity of an arbitration agreement or an award or to have the effect of either determined shall apply to the Court and the Court shall decide the question on affidavits: Provided that where the Court deems it just and expedi ent, it may set down the application for hearing on other evidence also.\\r\\nand it may pass such orders for discovery and particulars as it may do in a suit.\\r\\n\" The question to be decided is whether the point on which the parties are in dispute is a difference \"arising out of the policy\" in terms of clause 7 of the policy.\\r\\nThe test for determining such a question has been laid down in a series of cases and is a simple one.\\r\\nThe test is whether recourse to the contract by which the parties are bound is necessary for the purpose of determining the matter in dispute between them.\\r\\nIf such recourse to the contract is necessary.\\r\\nthen the matter must come within the scope of the arbitrator \\'s jurisdiction.\\r\\nIn the present case, both the parties admit the contract and state that they are bound by it.\\r\\nIndeed, the appellant company, in order to make good its contention, is obliged to rely and does rely on that part of clause 7 of the policy which states that if the company should disclaim liability and the claim be not referred to arbitration within 12 months of such disclaimer, the claim shall be deemed to have been abandoned.\\r\\nEvidently, the company cannot succeed without calling in aid this clause and 508 relying on it.\\r\\nAgain, the first respondent does not say that he is not bound by the clause but states that the matter was referred to arbitration before any valid disclaimer was made.\\r\\nThe position therefore is that one party relying upon the arbitration clause says that there has been a breach of its terms and the other party, also relying on that clause, says that there has been no breach but on the other hand the requirements of that clause have been fulfilled.\\r\\nThus, the point in dispute between the parties is one for the decision of which the appellant is compelled to invoke to his aid one of the terms of the insurance agreement.\\r\\nIt is thus clear that the difference between the parties is a difference arising out of the policy and the arbitrator had jurisdic tion to decide it, the parties having made him the sole judge of all differences arising out of the policy.\\r\\nA large number of cases were cited before us on behalf of the parties, but it is unnecessary to refer to them, since the question which arises in this appeal is a simple one and is covered by the statement of law which is to be found in the decision of this Court in A.M. Mair & Co. vs Gordhandass Sagarmull C), and in a series of English author ities, some of which only may be referred to.\\r\\nIn Heyman vs Darwins, Ltd. (2) the law on the subject has been very clearly stated in the following passage : \"An arbitration clause is a written submission, agreed to by the parties to the contract, and, like other written submissions to arbitration, must be construed according to its language and in the light of the circumstances in which it is made.\\r\\nIf the dispute is as to whether the contract which contains the clause has ever been entered into at all, that issue cannot go to arbitration under the clause, for the party who denies that he has ever entered into the contract is thereby denying that he has ever joined in the submission.\\r\\nSimilarly, if one party to the alleged contract is contending that it is void ab initio (because, for exam ple, the making of such a contract is illegal)the arbitra tion (1)[1950] S.C.R. 792.\\r\\n(2) [1941] 1 A.E.R.337,343 509 clause cannot operate, for on this view the clause \\' itself is also void.\\r\\nhowever, the parties are at one in asserting that they entered into a binding contract, but a difference has arisen between them as to whether there has been a breach by one side or the other, or as to whether circumstances have arisen which have discharged one or both parties from fur ther performance, such differences should be regarded as differences which have arisen \\'in respect of, \\' or \\'with regard to, \\' or \\'under \\' the contract, and an arbitration clause which uses these, or similar expressions, should be construed accordingly.\\r\\n\" In Macaura vs Northern Assurance Co. (1), the appellant had insured a large quantity of timber against fire and the greater part of the timber having been de stroyed by fire, he sued the insurance company to recover the loss but the action was stayed and the matter was re ferred to arbitration in pursuance of the conditions con tained in the policy.\\r\\nThe arbitrator held that the claimant had no insurable interest in the goods insured and disal lowed the claim.\\r\\nOne of the points raised in the case was that the arbitrator had no jurisdiction to decide the mat ter, but that contention was rejected by Lord Sumner in these words: \"The defendants do not repudiate the policy or dispute its validity as a contract; on the contrary, they rely on it and say that according to its terms, express and implied, they are, relieved from liability: see Stebbing \\'s case(2), Woodall vs Pearl Assurance Co.(3).\\r\\nIt is a Fallacy to say that they assert the policy to be null and void.\" In Stebbing vs Liverpool and London and Globe Insurance Company Limited(2), to which reference was made by Lord Summer, the policy of insurance contained a clause referring to the decision of an arbitrator \"all differences arising out of this policy \".\\r\\nIt also (1) (3) , (2) , 66 510 contained a recital that the assured had made a proposal and declaration as the basis of the contract, and a clause to the effect that compliance with the conditions indorsed upon the policy should be a condition precedent to any liability on the part of the insurers.\\r\\nOne of the conditions provided that if any false declaration should be made or used in support of a claim all benefit under the policy should be forfeited.\\r\\nIn answer to a claim by the assured, the insurers alleged that statements in the proposal and declaration were false.\\r\\nWhen the matter came before the arbitrator, the assured objected that this was not a difference in the arbitration and that the arbitrator had no power to deter mine whether the answers were true or not, or to determine any matters which called in question the validity of the policy.\\r\\nIn holding that the arbitrator had jurisdiction to decide the matter, Viscount Reading C.J. observed as fol lows: \" If the company were seeking to avoid the contract in the true sense they would have to rely upon some matter outside the contract, such as a misrepresentation of some material fact inducing the contract, of which the force and effect are not declared by the contract itself.\\r\\nIn that case the materiality of the fact and its effect in inducing the contract would have to be tried.\\r\\nIn the present case the company are claiming the benefit of a clause in the contract when they say that the parties have agreed that the statements in question are material and that they induced the contract.\\r\\nIf they succeed in escaping liability that is by reason of one of the clauses in the policy.\\r\\nIn resisting the claim they are not avoiding the policy but relying on its terms.\\r\\nIn my opinion, therefore, the question whether or not the statement is true is a question arising out of the policy.\\r\\n\" The main contention put forward on behalf of the appel lant is that the points in dispute fall outside the juris diction of the arbitrator, firstly because the existence of the arbitration agreement is challenged, and secondly, because the sole object of the application under section 33 of the Arbitration Act is tO have the 511 effect of the arbitration agreement determined.\\r\\nIn our opinion, neither of these objections is sound.\\r\\nHow can it be held that the existence of the arbitration agreement is challenged, when both parties admit that the clause in the policy which contains that agreement binds them.\\r\\nIt is neither party \\'s case that there is no arbitration agreement in the policy.\\r\\nOn the ,:other hand, both parties admit that such agreement exists, and each of them relies on it to support its case.\\r\\nIt is true that the appellant contends that the arbitration agreement has ceased to be applicable, but that contention cannot be sustained without having recourse to the arbitration agreement.\\r\\nIt is said that the agreement no longer subsists,but that is very different from saying that the agreement never existed or was void ab initio and therefore is to be treated as non existent.\\r\\nAgain, no question of determining the effect of the arbitration agreement arises, because there is no dispute between the parties as to what it means.\\r\\nThe language of the arbitration clause is quite clear, and both,parties construe it in the same way.\\r\\nThe real question between them is whether the first respondent has or has not complied with the conditions of the agreement.\\r\\nBut this question does not turn on the effect of the agreement.\\r\\nThis is the view which has substantially been taken by the High Court, and in our opinion it is correct.\\r\\nThe second point urged before us is that the award is invalid, since it was made in spite of the court \\'s injunc tion directing the arbitrator not to pronounce any award.\\r\\nThis point however does not, in our opinion, fall within the scope of this appeal.\\r\\nThe application under section 33 of the Arbitration Act, which is the subject of this appeal, was filed before the award was pronounced.\\r\\nIn that applica tion, there is no reference to the award; nor is there any reference to the circumstances which are now stated to invalidate the award and which happened after the applica tion was filed.\\r\\nThe learned counsel for the appellant made an application before us praying for the amendment of the petition under section 38 by introducing certain 512 additional facts and adding a prayer for declaring the award to be invalid, but it was rejected/by us.\\r\\nIt should be stated that as early as the 24th March, 1950, the Subordi nate Judge in dismissing the appellant \\'s petition under section 33, made the following observations : \"During the pendency of the arbitration proceedings the arbitrator pronounced the award. .\\r\\nThe award has now been filed in the court of section Mohinder Singh, Sub Judge, 1st class, Delhi.\\r\\nAny objection against the award can be filed there.\\r\\nIn this application in which there is no prayer for setting aside the award, which exists, I do not think it proper to decide the question of the validity of the award.\\r\\n\" In our opinion, the Subordinate Judge correctly indi cated the course which it was open to the appellant in law to adopt for the purpose of questioning the validity of the award, but not having taken that course and not having made any application in the courts below for amending the petition under section 33, the company cannot ask this court to go into the validity of the award by widening the scope of the original petition.\\r\\nThis court is always in favour of shortening litigation, but it would be a very unusual step to allow the petition under section 33 to be amended now and to decide a question involving investigation of facts with out having the benefit of the judgments of the courts below.\\r\\nIn the result, the appeal fails and is dismissed with costs.\\r\\nAppeal dismissed.\\r\\nAgent for respondent No. 1.: S.D.

JJ.\\r\\nagreed with Fazl Ali 5.\\r\\n221 FAZL ALI J.\\r\\nThis is an appeal from an order of the Madras High Court dismissing the petition of the appellant praying for a writ of certiorari.\\r\\nThe appellant was one of the persons who had filed nomination papers for election to the Madras Legislative Assembly from the Namakkal Constituency in Salem district.\\r\\nOn the 28th November, 1951, the Returning Officer for that constituency took up for scrutiny the nomination papers filed by the various candidates and on the same day he rejected the appellant \\'s nomination paper on certain grounds which need not be set out as they are not material to the point raised in this appeal.\\r\\nThe appellant thereupon moved the High Court under article 226 of the Constitution praying for a writ of of certiorari to quash the order of the Re turning Officer rejecting his nomination paper and to direct the Returning Officer to include his name in the list of valid nominations to be published.\\r\\nThe High Court dismissed the appellant \\'s application on the ground that it had no jurisdiction to interfere with the order of the Returning Officer by reason of the provisions of article 329(b) of the Constitution.\\r\\nThe appellant \\'s contention in this appeal is that the view expressed by the High Court is not correct, that the jurisdiction of the High Court is not affected by article 329 (b) of the Constitution and that he was enti tled to a writ of certiorari in the circumstances of the case.\\r\\nBroadly speaking, the arguments on which the judgment of the High Court is assailed are two fold : (1) that the conclusion arrived at by the High Court does not follow from the language of article 329 (b) of the Constitution, whether that article is read by itself or along with the other articles in Part XV of the Constitu tion; and (2) that the anomalies which will arise if the construc tion put by the High Court on article 329 (b) is accepted, are so startling that the courts should lean in favour of the construction put forward on behalf of the appellant.\\r\\n29 222 The first argument which turns on the construction of article 329 (b) requires serious consideration, but I think the second argument can be disposed of briefly at the out set.\\r\\nIt should be stated that what the appellant chooses to call anomaly can be more appropriately described as hardship or prejudice and what their nature will be has been stated in forceful language by Wallace J. in Sarvothama Rao vs Chairman, Municipal Council, Saidapet (1) in these words : \"I am quite clear that any post election remedy is wholly inadequate to afford the relief which the petitioner seeks, namely, that this election, now published be stayed, until it can be held with himself as a candidate.\\r\\nIt is no conso lation to tell him that he can stand for some other elec tion.\\r\\nIt is no remedy to tell him that he must let the election go on and then have it set aside by petition and have a fresh election ordered.\\r\\nThe fresh election may be under altogether different conditions and may bring forward an array of fresh candidates.\\r\\nThe petitioner can only have his proper relief if the proposed election without him is stayed until his rejected nomination is restored, and hence an injunction staying this election was absolutely neces sary, unless the relief asked for was to be denied him altogether in limine.\\r\\nIn most cases of this kind no doubt there will be difficulty for the aggrieved party to get in his suit in time before the threatened wrong is committed; but when he has succeeded in so doing, the Court cannot stultify itself by allowing the wrong which it is asked to prevent to be actually consummated while it is engaged in trying the suit.\\r\\n\" These observations however represent only one side of the picture and the same learned Judge presented the other side of the picture in a subsequent case [Desi Chettiar vs Chinnasami Chettiar(2)] in the following passage : \"The petitioner is not without his remedy.\\r\\nHis remedy lies in an election petition which we understand he has already put in.\\r\\nIt is argued for him (1) mad. 585 at 600.\\r\\n(2) at 1272.\\r\\nthat that remedy which merely allows him to have set aside an election once held is not as efficacious as the one which would enable him to stop the election altogether;and certain observations at p. 600 of Sarvothama Rao vs Chairman, Munic ipal Council, Saidapet(1) are quoted.\\r\\nIn the first place, we do not see how the mere fact that the petitioner cannot get the election stopped and has his remedy only after it is over by an election petition, will in itself confer on him any right to obtain a writ.\\r\\nIn the second place, these observations were directed to the consideration of the propriety of an injunction in a civil suit, a matter with which we are not here concerned.\\r\\nAnd finally it may.\\r\\nbe observed that these remarks were made some years ago when the practice of individuals coming forward to stop elections in order that their own individual interest may be safe guarded was not so common.\\r\\nIt is clear that there is anoth er side of the question to be considered, namely, the incon venience to the public administration of having elections and the business of Local Boards held up while individuals prosecute their individual grievances.\\r\\nWe understand the election for the elective seats in this Union has been held up since 31st May because of this petition, the result being that the electors have been unable since then to have any representation on the Board, and the Board is functioning, if indeed it is functioning, with a mere nominated fraction of its total strength; and this state of affairs the peti tioner proposes to have continued until his own personal grievance is satisfied.\" These observations which were made in regard to elec tions to Local Boards will apply with greater force to elections to legislatures, because it does not require much argument to show that in a country with a democratic consti tution in which the legislatures have to play a very impor tant role, it will lead to serious consequences, if the elections are unduly proracted or obstructed.\\r\\nTo this aspect of the matter I shall have to advert later.\\r\\nbut it is suffi cient for the present purpose (1) Mad, 585 at 600.\\r\\n224 to state firstly that in England the hardship and inconven ience which may be suffered by an individual candidate has not been regarded as of sufficient weight to induce Parlia ment to make provision for immediate relief and the ag grieved candidate has to wait until after the election to challenge the validity of the rejection of his nomina tion paper, and secondly, that the question of hardship or inconvenience is after all only a secondary question, be cause if the construction put by the High Court on article 329 (b) of the Constitution is found to be correct, the fact that such construction will lead to hardship and inconven ience becomes irrelevant.\\r\\nArticle 329 is the last article in Part XV of the Constitution, the heading of which is \"Elections\", and it runs as follows : \"Notwithstanding anything in this Constitution (a) the validity of any law relating to the delimitation of constituencies or the allotment of seats to such constit uencies, made or purporting to be made under article 327 or article 328, shall not be called in question in any court; (b) no election to either House of Parliament or to the House or either House of the Legislature of a State shall be called in question except by an election petition presented to such authority and in such manner as may be provided for, by, or under any law made by the appropriate Legislature.\\r\\n\" In construing this article, reference was made by both parties in the course of their arguments to the other arti cles in the same Part, namely, articles 324, 325, 326, 327 and 328.\\r\\nArticle 324 provides for the constitution and appointment of an Election Commissioner to superintend, direct and control ejections to the legislatures; article 325 prohibits discrimination against electors on the ground of religion, race, caste or sex; article 326 provides for adult suffrage; article 327 empowers Parliament to pass laws making provision with respect to all matters relating to, or in connection with, elections to the legislatures, subject 225 to the provisions of the Constitution; and article 328 is a complementary article giving power to the State Legislature to make provision with respect to all matters relating to, or in connection with, elections to the State Legislature.\\r\\nA notable difference in the language used in articles 327 and 328 on the one hand, and article 329 on the other, is that while the first \\' two articles begin with the words\" subject to the provisions of this Constitution\" the last article begins with the words \"notwithstanding anything in this Constitution.\\r\\n\" It was conceded at the bar that the effect of this difference in language is that whereas any law made by Parliament under article 327, or by the State Legislatures under article 328, cannot exclude the jurisdic tion of the High Court under article 226 of the Constitu tion, that jurisdiction is excluded in regard to matters provided for in article 329.\\r\\nNow, the main controversy in this appeal centres round the meaning of the words \"no election shall be called in question except by an election petition\" in article 329 (b), and the point to be decided is whether questioning the action of the Returning Officer in rejecting a nomination paper can be said to be comprehended within the words, \"no election shall be called in question.\\r\\n\" The appellant \\'s case is that questioning something which has happened before a candidate is declared elected is not the same thing as questioning an election, and the arguments advanced on his behalf in support of this construction were these: (1) That the word \"election\" as used in article 329 (b) means what it normally and etymologically means, namely, the result of polling or the final selection of a candidate; (2) That the fact that an election petition can be filed only after polling is over or after a candidate is declared elected, and what is normally called in question by such petition is the final result, bears out the conten tion that the word \"election \"can have no other meaning in article (b) than the result of polling or the final selec tion of a candidate; 226 (3) That the words \"arising out of or in connection with\" which are used in article 324 (1) and the words \"with respect to all matters relating to, or in connection with\" which are used in articles 327 and s28, show that the fram ers of the Constitution knew that it was necessary to use different language when referring respectively to matters which happen prior to and after the result of polling, and if they had intended to include the rejection of a nomina tion paper within the ambit of the prohibition contained in article S29 (b) they would have used similar language in that article and (4) That the action of the Returning Officer in reject ing a nomination paper can be questioned before the High Court under article 226 of the Constitution for the follow ing reason: Scrutiny of nomination papers and their rejec tion are provided for in section 36 of the Representation of the People Act, 1951.\\r\\nParliament has made this provision in exercise of the powers conferred on it by article 327 of the Constitution which is \"subject to the provisions of the Constitution\".\\r\\nTherefore, the action of the Returning Offi cer is subject to the extraordinary jurisdiction of the High Court under article 226.\\r\\nThese arguments appear at first sight to be quite im pressive, but in my opinion there are weightier and basical ly more important arguments in support of the view taken by the High Court.\\r\\nAs we have seen, the most important ques tion for determination is the meaning to be given to the word \"election\" in article 329 (b).\\r\\nThat word has by long usage in connection with the process of selection of proper representatives in democratic institutions, acquired both a wide and a narrow meaning.\\r\\nIn the narrow sense, it is used to mean the final selection of a candidate which may em brace the result of the poll when there is polling or a particular candidate being returned unopposed when there is no poll.\\r\\nIn the wide sense, the word is used to connote the entire process culminating in a candidate being declared 227 elected.\\r\\nIn Srinivasalu vs Kuppuswami(1), the learned Judges of the Madras High Court after examining the question, expressed the opinion that the term \"election\" may be taken to embrace the whole procedure whereby an \"elected member\" is returned, whether or not it be found necessary to take a poll.\\r\\nWith this view, my brother, Maimjan J. expressed his agreement in Sat Narain vs Hanuman Prasad (2); and I also find myself in agreement with it.\\r\\nIt seems to me that the word \"election\" has been used in Part XV of the Constitution in the wide sense, that is to say, to connote the entire procedure to be gone through to return a candidate to the legislature.\\r\\nThe use of the expression \"conduct of elections\" in article 324 specifically points to the wide meaning, and that meaning can also be read consistently into the other provisions which occur in Part XV including article 329 (b).\\r\\nThat the word \"election\" bears this wide meaning whenever we talk of elections in a democratic country, is borne out by the fact that in most of the books on the subject and in several cases dealing with the matter, one of the questions mooted is, when the election begins.\\r\\nThe subject is dealt with quite concisely in Halsbury \\'s Laws of England in the following passage(s) under the heading\" Commencement of the Election \": \"Although the first formal step in every election is the issue of the writ, the election is considered for some purposes to begin at an earlier date.\\r\\nIt is a question of fact in each case when an election begins in such a way as to make the parties concerned responsible for breaches of election law, the test being whether the contest is \"reason ably imminent\".\\r\\nNeither the issue of the writ nor the publi cation of the notice of election can be looked to as fixing the date when an election begins from this point of view.\\r\\nNor, again, does the nomination day afford any criterion.\\r\\nThe election will usually begin at least earlier than the issue of the writ.\\r\\nThe question when the election begins must be care (1) at 255.\\r\\n(2) (3) See page 237 of Halsbury \\'s Laws of England, 2nd edition, Volume 12.\\r\\n228 fully distinguished from that as to when \"the conduct and management of\" an election may be said to begin.\\r\\nAgain, the question as to when a particular person commences to be a candidate is a question to be considered in each case.\\r\\n\" The discussion in this passage makes it clear that the word \\' \\'election\" can be and has been appropriately used with reference to the entire process which consists of several stages and embraces many steps, some of which may have an important bearing on the result of the process.\\r\\nThe next important question to be considered is what is meant by the words \"no election shall be called in ques tion\".\\r\\nA reference to any treatise on elections in England will show that an election proceeding in that country is liable to be assailed on very limited grounds, one of them being the improper rejection of a nomination paper.\\r\\nThe law with which we are concerned is not materially different, and we find that in section 100 of the Representation of the People Act, 1951, one of the grounds for declaring an elec tion to be void is the improper rejection of a nomination paper.\\r\\nThe question now arises whether the law of elections in this country contemplates that there should be two attacks on matters connected with election proceedings, one while they are going on by invoking the extraordinary jurisdiction of the High Court under article 226 of the Constitution (the ordinary jurisdiction of the courts having been expressly excluded), and another after they have been completed by means of an election petition.\\r\\nIn my opinion, to affirm such a position would be contrary to the scheme of Part XV of the Constitution and the Representation of the People Act, which, as I shall point out later, seems to be that any matter which has the effect of vitiating an election should be brought up only at the appropriate stage in an appropri ate manner before a special tribunal and should not be brought up at an intermediate stage before any court.\\r\\nIt seems to me that under the election law, the only signifi cance which the rejection of 229 a nomination paper has consists in the fact that it can be used as a ground to call the election in question.\\r\\nArti cle 329(b)was apparently enacted to prescribe the manner in which and the stage at which this ground, and other grounds which may be raised under the law to call the election in question could be urged.\\r\\nI think it follows by necessary implication from the language of this provision that those grounds cannot be urged in any other manner, at any other stage and before any other court.\\r\\nIf the grounds on which an election can be called in question could be raised at an earlier stage and errors, if any, are rectified, there will be no meaning in enacting a provision like article 329 (b) and in setting up a special tribunal.\\r\\nAny other meaning ascribed to the words used in the article would lead to anomalies, which the Constitution could not have contemplat ed, one of them being that conflicting views may be ex pressed by the High Court at the pre polling stage and by the election tribunal, which is to be an independent body, at the stage when the matter is brought up before it.\\r\\nI think that a brief examination of the scheme of Part XV of the Constitution and the Representation of the People Act, 1951, will show that the construction I have suggested is the correct one.\\r\\nBroadly speaking, before an election machinery can be brought into operation, there are three requisites which require to be attended to, namely, (1) there should be a set of laws and rules making provisions with respect to all matters relating to, or in connection with, elections, and it should be decided as to how these laws and rules are to be made;(2) there should be an execu tive charged with the duty of securing the due conduct of elections; and (3)there should be a judicial tribunal to deal with disputes arising out of or in connection with elections.\\r\\nArticles 327 and 328 deal with the first of these requisites, article 324 with the second and article 329 with the third requisite.\\r\\nThe other two articles in Part XV, viz, articles 325 and 326, deal with two matters of princi ple to which the Constitution framers have attached much importance.\\r\\nThey 30 230 are : (1) prohibition against discrimination in the prepa ration of, or eligibility for inclusion in, the electoral rolls, on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or any of them; and (2) adult suffrage.\\r\\nPart XV of the Constitution is really a code in itself providing the entire ground work for enacting appropriate laws and setting up suitable ma chinery for the conduct of elections.\\r\\nThe Representation of the People Act, 1951, which was passed by Parliament under article 327 of the Constitution.\\r\\nmakes detailed provisions in regard to all matters and all stages connected with elections to the various legislatures in this country.\\r\\nThat Act is divided into II parts, and it is interesting to see the wide variety of subjects they deal with.\\r\\nPart Il deals with \"the qualifications and disquali fications for membership\", Part III deals with the notifica tion of General Elections, Part IV provides for the adminis trative machinery for the conduct of elections, and Part V makes provisions for the actual conduct of elections and deals with such matters as presentation of nomination pa pers.\\r\\nrequirements of a valid nomination, scrutiny of nomi nations, etc., and procedure for polling and counting of votes.\\r\\nPart VI deals with disputes regarding elections and provides for the manner of presentation of election peti tions, the constitution of election tribunals and the trial of election petitions.\\r\\nPart VII outlines the various cor rupt and illegal practices which may affect the elections, and electoral offences.\\r\\nObviously, the Act is a self contained enactment so far as elections are concerned, which means that whenever we have to ascertain the true position in regard to any matter connected with elections, we have only to look at the Act and the rules made thereunder.\\r\\nThe provisions of the Act which are material to the present discussion are sections 80, 100, 105 and 170, and the provi sions of Chapter II of Part IV dealing with the form of election petitions, their contents and the reliefs which may be sought in them.\\r\\nSection 80, which is drafted in almost the same language as article 329 (b), provides that \"no election shall be called in question except by an election 231 petition presented in accordance with the provisions of this Part\".\\r\\nSection 100, as we have already seen, provides for the grounds on which an election may be called in question, one of which is the improper rejection of a nomination paper.\\r\\nSection 105 says that \"every order of the Tribunal made under this Act shall be final and conclusive\".\\r\\nSection 170 provides that \"no civil court shall have jurisdiction to question the legality of any action taken or of any decision given by the Returning Officer or by any other person appointed under this Act in connection with an elec tion.\\r\\n\" These are the main provisions regarding election matters being judicially dealt with, and it should be noted that there is no provision anywhere to the effect that anything connected with elections can be questioned at an intermediate stage.\\r\\nIt is now well recognized that where a right or liability is created by a statute which gives a special remedy for en forcing it, the remedy provided by that statute only must be availed of.\\r\\nThis rule was stated with great clarity by Willes J. in Wolverhampton New Water Works Co. vs Hawkes ford(1) in the following passage : \"There are three classes of cases in which a liability may be established founded upon statute.\\r\\nOne is, where there was a liability existing at common law and that li ability is affirmed by a statute which gives a special and peculiar form of remedy different from the remedy which existed at common law;there, unless the statute contains words which expressly or by necessary implication exclude the common law remedy, the party suing has his election to pursue either that or the statutory remedy.\\r\\nThe second class of cases is, where the statute gives the right to suemerely, but provides no particular form of remedy: there, the party can only proceed by action at common law.\\r\\nBut there is a third class, viz., where a liability not existing at common law is created by a statute which at the same time gives a special and particular remedy for enforcing it. .\\r\\nThe remedy provided by the statute must be followed, and it is not (1) ; , 356.\\r\\n232 competent to the party to pursue the course applicable to cases of the second class.\\r\\nThe form given by the statute must be adopted and adhered to.\\r\\n\" The rule laid down in this passage was approved by the House of Lords in Neville vs London Express Newspaper Limit ed(1) and has been reaffirmed by the Privy Council in Attorney General of Trinidad and Tobago vs Gordon Grant & Co.(2) and Secretary of State vs Mask & Co.(a); and it has also been held to be equally applicable to enforcement of rights: see Hurdutrai vs Official Assignee of Calcutta(4).\\r\\nThat being so, I think it will be a fair inference from the provisions of the Representation of the People Act to state that the Act provides for only one remedy, that remedy being by an election petition to be presented after the election is over, and there is no remedy provided at any intermediate stage.\\r\\nIt was argued that since the Representation of the People Act was enacted subject to the provisions of the Constitution, it cannot bar the jurisdiction of the High Court to issue writs under article 226 of the Constitution.\\r\\nThis argument however is completely shut out by reading the Act along with article 329 (b).\\r\\nIt will be noticed that the language used in that article and in section 80 of the Act is almost identical, with this difference only that the article is preceded by the words \"notwithstanding anything in this Constitution\".\\r\\nI think that those words are quite apt to exclude the jurisdiction of the High Court to deal with any matter which may arise while the elections are in progress.\\r\\nIt may be stated that section 107(1) of the Representation of People Act, 1949 (12 & 13 Geo.\\r\\n6, c. 68) in England is drafted almost in the same language as article 329(b).\\r\\nThat section runs thus : \"No parliamentary election and no return to Parliament shall be questioned except by a petition complaining of an undue election or undue return (hereinafter referred to as a parliamentary election petition) presented in accordance with this Part of this Act.\\r\\n\" (1) (3) (2) [1935] A.C. 532.\\r\\n(4) , 349.\\r\\n233 It appears that similar language was used in the earlier statutes, and it is noteworthy that it has never been held in England that the improper rejection of a nomination paper can be the subject of a writ of certiorari or mandamus.\\r\\nOn the other hand, it was conceded at the bar that the ques tion of improper rejection of a nomination paper has always been brought up in that country before the appropriate tribunal by means of an election petition after the conclu sion of the election.\\r\\nIt is true that there is no direct decision holding that the words used in the relevant provi sions exclude the jurisdiction of the High Court to issue appropriate prerogative writs at an intermediate stage of the election, but the total absence of any such decision can be accounted for only on the view that the provisions in question have been generally understood to have that effect.\\r\\nOur attention was drawn to rule 13 of the rules appended to the Ballot Act of 1872 and a similar rule in the Parliamen tary Elections Rules of 1949, providing that the decision of the Returning Officer disallowing an objection to a nomina tion paper shall be final, but allowing the same shall be subject to reversal on a petition questioning the election or return.\\r\\nThese rules however do not affect the main argument.\\r\\nI think it can be legitimately stated that if words similar to those used in article 329 (b) have been consistently treated in England as words apt to exclude the jurisdiction of the courts including the High Court, the same consequence must follow from the words used in article 329 (b) of the Constitution.\\r\\nThe words \"notwithstanding anything in this Constitution\" give to that article the same wide and binding effect as a statute passed by a sover eign legislature like the English Parliament.\\r\\nIt may be pointed out that article 329 (b) must be read as complimentary to clause (a) of that article.\\r\\nClause (a) bars the jurisdiction of the courts with regard to such law as may be made under articles 327 and 328 relating to the delimitation of constituencies or the allotment of seats to such constituencies.\\r\\nIt was conceded before us that article 329 (b) ousts the jurisdiction of the courts with regard to matters 234 arising between the commencement of the polling and the final selection.\\r\\nThe question which has to be asked is what conceivable reason the legislature could have had to leave only matters connected with nominations subject to the jurisdiction of the High Court under article 226 of the Constitution.\\r\\nIf Part XV of the Constitution is a code by itself, i. e., it creates rights and provides for their enforcement by a special tribunal to the exclusion of all courts including the High Court, there can be no reason for assuming that the Constitution left one small part of the election process to be made the subject matter of contest before the High Courts and thereby upset the time schedule of the elections The more reasonable view seems to be that article 329 covers all \"electoral matters\".\\r\\nThe conclusions which I have arrived at may be summed up briefly as follows : (1) Having regard to the important functions which the legislatures have to perform in democratic countries, it has always been recognized to be a matter of first importance that elections should be concluded as early as possible according to time schedule and all controversial matters and all disputes arising out of elections should be postponed till after the elections are over, so that the election proceedings may not be unduly retarded or protracted.\\r\\n(2) In conformity with this principle, the scheme the elec tion law in this country as well as in England is that no significance should be attached to anything which does not affect the \"election\"; and if any irregularities are commit ted while it is in progress and they belong to the category or class which, under the law by which elections are gov erned, would have the effect of vitiating the \\' \\'election\" and enable the person affected to call it in question, they should be brought up before a special tribunal by means of an election petition and not be made the subject of a dis pute before any court while the election is in progress.\\r\\nIt will be useful at this stage to refer to the deci sion the Privy Council in Theberge vs Laudry(1).\\r\\nThe (1) 235 petitioner in that case having been declared duly elected a member to represent an electoral district in the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Quebec, his election was after wards, on petition, declared null and void by judgment of the Superior Court, under the Quebec Controverted Elections Act, 1875, and himself declared guilty of corrupt practices both personally and by his agents.\\r\\nThereupon, he applied for special leave to appeal to Her Majesty in Council, but it was refused on the ground that the fair construction of the Act of 1875 and the Act of 1872 which preceded it providing among other things that the judgment of the Superior Court \"shall not be susceptible of appeal\" was that it was the intention of the legislature to create a tribunal for the purpose of trying election petitions in a manner which should make its decision final for all purposes, and should not annex to it the incident of its judgment being reviewed by the Crown under its prerogative.\\r\\nIn delivering the judgment of the Privy Council, Lord Cairns observed as follows : \"These two Acts of Parliament, the Acts of 1872 and 1875, are Acts peculiar in their character.\\r\\nThey are not Acts constituting or providing for the decision of mere ordinary civil rights; they are Acts creating an entirely new, and up to that time unknown, jurisdiction in a partic ular Court. for the purpose of taking out, with its own consent, of the Legislative Assembly, and vesting in that Court, that very peculiar jurisdiction which, up to that time, had existed in the Legislative Assembly of decid ing election petitions, and determining the: status of those who claimed to be members of the Legislative Assembly.\\r\\nA jurisdiction of that kind is extremely special, and one of the obvious incidents or consequences of such a jurisdiction must be that the jurisdiction, by whomsoever it is to be exercised, should be exercised in a way that should as soon as possible become conclusive; and enable the constitution of the Legislative Assembly to be distinctly and speedily known.\\r\\n\" 236 After dealing with certain other matters, the Lord ChanCellor proceeded to make the following further observa tions : \"Now, the subject matter, as has been said, of the legislation is extremely peculiar.\\r\\nIt concerns the rights and privileges of the electors and of the Legislative Assem bly to which they elect members.\\r\\nThose rights and privi leges have always in every colony, following the example of the mother country, been jealously maintained and guarded by the Legislative Assembly.\\r\\nAbove all, they have been looked upon as rights and privileges which pertain to the Legisla tive Assembly, in complete independence of the Crown, so far as they properly exist.\\r\\nAnd it would be a result somewhat surprising, and hardly in consonance with the general scheme of the legislation, if, with regard to rights and privileges of this kind, it were to be found that in the last resort the determination of them no longer belonged to the Legis lative Assembly, no longer belonged to the Superior Court which the Legislative Assembly had put in its place, but belonged to the Crown in Council, with the advice of the advisers of the Crown at home, to be determined without reference either to the judgment of the Legislative Assem bly, or of that Court which the Legislative Assembly had substituted in its place.\\r\\n\" The points which emerge from this decision may be stated as follows : (1) The right to vote or stand as a candidate for elec tion is not a civil right but is a creature of statute or special law and must be subject to the limitations emposed by it.\\r\\n(2) Strictly speaking, it is the sole right of the Legislature to examine and determine all matters relating to the election of its own members, and if the legislature takes it out of its own hands and vests in a special tribu nal an entirely new and unknown jurisdiction, that special jurisdiction should be exercised in accordance with the law which creates it.\\r\\n237 It should be mentioned here that the question as to what the powers of the High Court under articles 226 and 227 and of this Court under article 136 of the Constitution may be, is one that will have to be decided on a proper occasion.\\r\\nIt is necessary to refer at this stage to an argument advanced before us on behalf of the appellant which was based on the language of article 71 (1) of the Constitution.\\r\\nThat provision runs thus : \"All doubts and disputes arising out of or in connection with the election of a President or Vice President shall be inquired into and decided by the Supreme Court whose deci sion shall be final.\\r\\n\" The argument was as follows.\\r\\nThere is a marked contrast between the language used in article 71 (1) and that of article 329 (b).\\r\\nThe difference in the phraseology employed in the two provisions suggests that they could not have been intended to have the same meaning and scope as regards matters to be brought up before the tribunals they respec tively deal with.\\r\\nIf the framers of the Constitution, who apparently knew how to express themselves, intended to include within the ambit of article 329 (b) all possible disputes connected with elections to legislatures, includ ing disputes as to nominations, they would have used similar words as are to be found in article 71 (1).\\r\\nIt is true that it is not necessary to use identical language in every provision, but one can conceive of various alternative ways of expression which would convey more clearly and properly what article 329 (b) is said to convey.\\r\\nIt seems to me that once it is admitted that the same idea can be expressed in different ways and the same phrase ology need not be employed in every provision, the argument loses much of its force.\\r\\nBut, however that may be, I think there is a good explanation as to why article 329 (b) was drafted as it stands.\\r\\nA reference to the election rules made under the Govern ment of India Acts of 1919 and 1935 will show that the provisions in them on the subject were almost in the same language as article 329 (b).\\r\\nThe 21 238 corresponding rule made under the Government of India Act, 1919, was rule 31 of the electoral rules, and it runs as follows : \"No election shall be called in question, except by an election petition presented in accordance with the provi sions of this Part.\\r\\n\" It should be noted that this rule occurs in Part VII, the heading of which is \"The final decision of doubts and disputes as to the validity of an election\".\\r\\nThese words throw some light on the function which the election tribunal was to perform, and they are the very words which the learned counsel for the appellant argued, ought to have been used to make the meaning clear.\\r\\nThe same scheme was followed in the election rules framed under the Government of India Act, 1935, which are contained in \"The Government of India (Provincial Elections) (Corrupt Practices and Election Petitions) Order, 1936\", dated the 3rd July, 1936.\\r\\nIn that Order, the rule corre sponding to rule 31 under the earlier Act, runs thus : \"No election shall be called in question except by an election petition presented in accordance with the provi sions of this Part of the Order.\" This rule is to be found in Part III of the Order, the heading of which is \"Decision of doubts and disputes as to validity of an election and disqualification for corrupt practices.\\r\\n\" The rules to which I have referred were apparently framed on the pattern of the corresponding provisions of the British Acts of 1868 and 1872, and they must have been intended to cover the same ground as the provisions in England have been understood to cover in that country for so many years.\\r\\nIf the language used in article 329 (b) is considered against this historical background, it should not be difficult to see why the framers of the Constitution framed that provision in its present form and chose the language which had been consistently used in certain earlier legislative provisions and which had stood the test of time.\\r\\n239 And now a word as to why negative language was used in article 829 (b).\\r\\nIt seems to me that there is an important difference between article 71 (1) and article 329 (b).\\r\\nArticle 71 (1) had to be in an affirmative form, because it confers special jurisdiction on the Supreme Court which that Court could not have exercised but for this article.\\r\\nArti cle 329 (b), on the other hand, was primarily intended to exclude or oust the jurisdiction of all courts in regard to electoral matters and to lay down the only mode in which an election could be challenged.\\r\\nThe negative form was there fore more appropriate, and, that being so, it is not sur prising that it was decided to follow the preexisting pat tern in which also the negative language had been adopted.\\r\\nBefore concluding, I should refer to an argument which was strenuously pressed by the learned counsel for the appellant and which has been reproduced by one of the learned Judges of the High Court in these words: \"It was next contended that if nomination is part election, a dis pute as to the validity of nomination is a dispute relating to election and that can be called in question only in accordance with the provisions of article 329 (b) by the presentation of an election petition to the appropriate Tribunal and that the Returning Officer would have no juris diction to decide that matter and it was further argued that section 36 of Act XLIII of 1981 would be ultra vires inasmuch as it confers on the Returning Officer a jurisdic tion which, article 329 (b) confers on a Tribunal to be appointed in accordance with the article.\\r\\n\" This argument displays great dialectical ingenuity, but it has no bearing on the result of this appeal and I think it can be very shortly answered.\\r\\nUnder section 36 of the Representation.\\r\\nof the People Act, 1951, it is the duty of the Returning Officer to scrutinize the nomination papers to ensure that they comply with the requirements of the Act and decide all objections which be made to any nomination.\\r\\nIt is clear that unless this duty is discharged properly, any number of candidates may stand for election without comply ing with the provisions of the Act and a great deal of 240 confusion may ensue.\\r\\nIn discharging the statutory duty imposed on him, the Returning Officer does not call in question any election.\\r\\nScrutiny of nomination papers is only a stage, though an important stage, in the election process.\\r\\nIt is one of the essential duties to be performed before the election can be completed, and anything done towards the completion of the election proceeding can by no stretch of reasoning be described as questioning the elec tion.\\r\\nThe fallacy of the argument lies in treating a single step taken in furtherance of an election as equivalent to election.\\r\\nThe decision of this appeal however turns not on the construction of the single word \"election\", but on the construction of the compendious expression \"no election shall be called in question\" in its context and setting, with due regard to the scheme of Part XV of the Constitution and the Representation of the People Act, 1951.\\r\\nEvidently, the argument has no bearing on this method of approach to the question posed in this appeal, which appears to me to be the only correct method.\\r\\nWe are informed that besides the Madras High Court, seven other State High Courts have held that they have no jurisdiction under article 226 of the Constitution to enter tain petitions regarding improper rejection of nomination papers.\\r\\nThis view is in my opinion correct and must be affirmed.\\r\\nThe appeal must therefore fail and is dismissed.\\r\\nIn view of the nature and importance of the points raised in this appeal, there should be no order to costs.\\r\\nPATANJALI SASTRI C.J.

Chatterjee (A. N. Sinha, with him)for the respond ents Nos. 1 to 9.\\r\\nB.K. Saran for the respondents Nos.\\r\\n11 to 16.\\r\\nApril 14.\\r\\nThe Judgment of the Court was deliv ered by CHANDRASEKHARA AIYAR J.\\r\\nThis is an appeal by the defendants from a decree of the Patna High Court reversing a decree of the Subordinate Judge \\'s Court at Patna, and de creeing the plaintiffs \\' suit for possession against the defendant first party who may be called for the sake of convenience as \\'the Gopes \\'.\\r\\nThe lands were khudkhasht lands, partly belonging to the plaintiffs first party and partly belonging to Mussammat Anaro Kuer, from whom the plaintiffs second and third par ties trace title.\\r\\nThe ancestors of plaintiffs first party gave on 28 9 1899 an ijara with possession to one Lakhandeo Singh an ancestor of the defendant second party under Exhib it I (b) for a term 777 of six years from 1307 Fasli to 1312 Fasli for Rs. 540.\\r\\nThe poshgi money was to be repaid in one lump sum at the end of Fasli 1312.\\r\\nIf there was no redemption then the ijara was to continue in force till the money was repaid.\\r\\nMussammat Anaro Kuer gave her share in ijara to the same Lakhandeo Singh orally on 10th June, 1905, for a period of three years for Rs. 542.\\r\\nLakhandeo Singh, who is represented now by the defendant second party, made a settlement of the land thus got by him (8.26 acres or 13 bighas in all) with one Ram Lal Gope an ancestor of the defendant first party for a period of three years from Fasli 1315 to Fasli 1318.\\r\\nThere was a patta in favour of the tenant and a kabuliyat in favour of the landlord.\\r\\nThis was in 1908.\\r\\nThe mortgage was redeemed in June 1942 by payment in proceedings under section 83 of the Transfer of Property Act, When the plaintiffs went to take possession, they were resisted by the Gopes (defendant first party), and after unsuccessful criminal proceedings, the plaintiffs filed the present suit.\\r\\nThe Subordinate Judge dismissed it, holding that the Gopes were raiyats having acquired permanent occupancy rights in the lands as the result of the settlement by the mortgagee, Lakhandeo Singh.\\r\\nOn appeal the High Court set aside this decision and gave the plaintiffs a decree for possession on the finding that the defendants were not raiyats and had no permanent rights of occupancy.\\r\\nThis court granted to the defendants special leave to appeal.\\r\\nThe suit was in the alternative for recovery of the value of the lands as compensation or damages from the defendant second party in case it was found that the defendant first party could not be ejected.\\r\\nThe trial court decreed this alternative claim and awarded to the plaintiffs compensation at the rate of Rs. 200 per bigha.\\r\\nThe defendant second party carried the matter in appeal to the High Court and succeeded.\\r\\nBut we have nothing to do with this matter in the present appeal.\\r\\nAt the trial, the plaintiffs alleged and maintained that the lands were their zirat lands within the meaning SUPREME 778 of section 116 of the Bihar Tenancy Act and that the defend ant first party could acquire no rights of occupancy in the same.\\r\\nThe Subordinate Judge found against this contention and held that they were khud kasht or bakasht lands of the proprietor, in which rights of occupancy can be acquired He negatived the plea of the defendants that they were their ancestral raiyati lands.\\r\\nHe also held that there was no collusion between the mortgagee Lakhandeo Singh and Ram Lal Gope in the matter of settlement of lands.\\r\\nIt is on the basis of these findings which were accepted by both the parties that the hearing of the appeal proceeded before the High Court.\\r\\nIt was held by the Privy Council in Bengal Indigo Company vs Roghobur Das(1) that \"a zuripeshgi lease is not a mere contract for the cultivation of the land at a rent, but is a security to the tenant for the money advanced\".\\r\\nThey observed, speaking of the leases before them, that \"the leases in question were not mere contracts for the cultiva tion of the land let; but that they were also intended to constitute, and did constitute, a real and valid security to the tenant for the principal sums which he had advanced, and interest thereon.\\r\\nThe tenants \\' possession under them was, in part at least, not that of cultivators only, but that of creditors operating repayment of the debt due to them, by means of their security.\\r\\n\" These words apply to the ijara deed before us; its dominant intention was to provide a security for the loan advanced and not to bring into existence any relationship of landlord and ten ant.\\r\\nThe general rule is that a person cannot by transfer or otherwise confer a better title on another than he himself has.\\r\\nA mortgagee cannot, therefore, create an interest in the mortgaged property which will enure beyond the termina tion of his interest as mortgagee.\\r\\nFurther, the mortgagee, who takes possession of the mortgaged property, must manage it as a person of ordinary prudence would manage it if it were his own; and he must not commit any act which is de structive (1) 779 or permanently injurious to the property; see section 76, sub clauses (a) & (e)of the Transfer of Property Act.\\r\\nIt follows that he may grant leases not extending beyond the period of the mortgage; any leases granted by him must come to an end at redemption.\\r\\nA mortgagee cannot during the subsistence of the mortgage act in a manner detrimental to the mortgagor \\'s interests such as by giving a lease which may enable the tenant to acquire permanent or occupancy rights in the land thereby defeating the mortgagor \\'s right to khas possession; it would be an act which would fall within the provisions of section 76, subclause (e), of the Transfer of Property Act.\\r\\nA permissible settlement by a mortgagee in possession with a tenant in the course of prudent management and the springing up of rights in the tenant conferred or created by statute based on the nature of the land and possession for the requisite period is a different matter altogether.\\r\\nIt is an exception to the general rule.\\r\\nThe tenant cannot be ejected by the mortgagor even after the redemption of the mortgage.\\r\\nHe may become an occupancy raiyat in some cases and a non occupancy raiyat in other cases.\\r\\nBut the settle ment of the tenant by the mortgagee must have been a bona fide one.\\r\\nThis exception will not apply in a case where the terms of the mortgage prohibit the mortgagee from making any settlement of tenants on the land either expressly or by necessary implication.\\r\\nWhere all the zamindari rights are given to the mortga gee, it may be possible to infer on the proper construction of the document that he can settle lands with tenants in the ordinary course of management and the tenants might acquire certain rights in the land in their capacity as tenants.\\r\\nIn the case of Manjhil Lal Biswa Nath Shah Deo vs Shaikh Mo hiuddin(1), there was a bona fide settlement of mortgaged rayati land by the mortgagee with tenants and it was held that the mortgagor was not entitled to evict them after redemption.\\r\\nThe earlier decision of Babu Bhairo Nath Ray vs Shanke Pahan(2), related to bakasht lands, and (1) (2) Pat.31.\\r\\n780 there was no provision in the zuripeshgi lease restricting the power of the mortgagee lessee as regards settlement of tenants.\\r\\nKhudkasht lands and bakasht lands are really in the nature of raiyati lands which come into the possession of the proprietor by surrender, abandonment or purchase.\\r\\nIn the present case.\\r\\nwe have the following clause in the ijara deed: \"It is desired that the ijaradar should enter into possession and occupation of the share let out in ijara (being the khudkasht land under his own cultivation), culti vate them, pay 2 annas as reserved rent year after year to us, the executants, and appropriate the produce thereof year after year on account of his having the ijaradari interest.\\r\\n\" This term disentitles the mortgagee from locating tenants on the land mortgaged.\\r\\nRam Lal Gope, the grandfather of the defendants first party, who executed the kabuliat in 1908 must have known of the title of Lakhandeo Singh the mortga gee and the terms under which he held the lands under the registered zuripeshgi ijara deed and this is most probably why the tenant not only took the lease for a period of 3 years, but expressly undertook to give up possession over the thika lands on the expiry of the period of lease without urging any claim on the score that the lands were his old kasht lands.\\r\\nHis kabuliat (Exhibit 11) in fact refers to Lakhandeo Singh \\'s ijaradari interest.\\r\\nIn view of these facts, the learned Judges of the High Court stated that they were not prepared to hold that the settlement was a bona fide one or the mortgagee was within his rights in settling these lands.\\r\\nStrong reliance was placed for the appellants on the Full Bench decision Binad Lal Pakrashi and Others vs Kalu Pramanik and Others (1) where it was held that a person inducted into possession of land as a raiyat even by a trespasser became a non occupancy raiyat within the meaning of section 5, sub section, 2 of the Bengal Tenancy Act and was protected from ejectment.\\r\\nBut this decision has been subsequently (1) Cal.\\r\\n781 explained away in several cases as based on the proposition that the rights must have been bona fide acquired by them from one whom they bona fide believed to \\' have the right to let them into possession of the land.\\r\\nSuch, however, is not the case here, in view of the recitals in the ijara deed in favour of Lakhandeo Singh and the kabuliat by Ram Lal Gope.\\r\\nSections 20 and 21 of the Bihar Tenancy Act were re ferred to by the learned counsel for the appellants in the course of his arguments and he pointed out that the land in this case was held \\' continuously by his clients and their predecessors from 1908 to 1942, when they were sought to be ejected.\\r\\nFor these sections to apply, we must be in a position to hold that the appellants were \"settled raiy ats\".\\r\\n\"Raiyals\" is defined in sub clause 2 of section 5 as meaning \"primarily a person who has acquired a right to hold land for the purpose of cultivating it by himself or by members of his family . \" Sub clause 3 provides that a person shall not be deemed to be a raiyat unless he holds land either immediately under a proprietor or immediately under a tenure holder.\\r\\nLakhandeo Singh was not a \"proprie tor\" by which term is meant a person owning, whether in trust or for his own benefit, an estate or part of an es tate: he was only a mortgagee.\\r\\nNor was he a tenure holder or under tenureholder, as he does not comply with the defi nition given in sub clause (1) of section 5, namely, a person who had acquired from a proprietor or from another tenure holder a right to hold land for the purpose of col lecting rents, or for the purpose of bringing the land under cultivation by establishing tenants on it.\\r\\nSuch proof as there is in this case only goes to show that the lands were under the cultivation of the plaintiffs and that they were made over to the possession of the mortgagee so that he might cultivate them himself.\\r\\nHence, Ram Lal Gope could not claim that he was a settled raiyat of the village and that under the statute he secured occupancy rights in the lands Which he took on lease from Lakhandeo Singh.\\r\\n782 Lastly, it was urged that the ijara by Mst.\\r\\nAnaro Kuer was admittedly an oral transaction and there was no proof of any prohibition against the settlement with tenants so far as her share (3.97 acres) was concerned and that the rights of the parties as regards this area would stand on a differ ent footing from the rights in respect of the 4 acres and 29 cents belonging to the plaintiff first party.\\r\\nThis point was not taken in the courts below where the two ijaras given to Lakhandeo Singh were dealt with as if they were part and parcel of one and the same transaction, the rights and liabilities, whatever they were, being common to both.\\r\\nWe cannot allow the point to be taken now.\\r\\nThe result is that the High Court \\'s decree is con firmed and the appeal is dismissed with costs of the plain tiffs respondents.\\r\\nThere will be no order as to costs of the other respondents.\\r\\nAppeal dismissed.\\r\\nAgent for the respondents

High Court at Orissa, delivered on five petitions filed by the respondent in each of the appeals, to obtain from the Court a writ of mandamus and/or directions under article 226 of \\'the Constitution of India.\\r\\nEach of the respondents alleged that between 1941 and 1947 he had agreed to take from the Ruler of Keonjhar a mining lease and had entered into possession of the area.\\r\\nSome of the petitioners alleged that they had spent money on the development of the mines and installed machinery to work the same.\\r\\nIt is however common ground that there was no registered lease in favour of any of the respondents before 1947.\\r\\nOn the 14th December, 1947, the Ruler of Keonjhar entered into a merger agreement with the Dominion of India and as from the 1st January, 1948, the State was merged in the Dominion of India.\\r\\nAfter signing the merger agreement the Ruler gave registered 30 leases on the 27th December, 1947, to the respondents in these appeals.\\r\\nIn pursuance of the exercise of the powers conferred on the Government of Orissa by section 4 of the Extra Provincial Jurisdiction Act, 1949, read with Notifica tion No. 172/1B dated 23rd March, 1948, of the Government of India, the Government of Orissa issued a notification dated the 8th of June, 1949, declaring, inter alia, the said leases to be void and not binding on it.\\r\\nThis annulment was made expressly on the ground that these commitments were not reasonable and bona fide.\\r\\nThereafter, the respondents, along with others approached the Orissa Government to give them leases and the State Government gave them temporary permits to work the mines in November, 1949.\\r\\nOn the 3rd July, 1951, however they passed an order cancelling the temporary per mits and directed the respondents to remove their assets appertaining to the respective mines within a fortnight.\\r\\nThe respondents thereupon filed the petitions before the Orissa High Court praying for writs or directions in the nature of mandamus against the State of Orissa directing them to withdraw the notices dated the 8th of June and 3rd of July, 1951, and to forbear from acting upon or giving effect to the same.\\r\\nThe Court, after noticing the rival contentions of the parties and rejecting the contention that the State of Orissa had cancelled the permits and were attempting to take possession as an act of State, posed the question \"whether the law of annulment relied upon by the State was applicable to the mining leases granted to the petitioners, or in the alternative, whether the State had any right in law to cancel the leases before the period mentioned therein.\\r\\n\" Referring to the contention of the State rounded on the acceptance by the respondents of the temporary permits and the estoppel arising therefrom, Ray C.J. in his judgment stated as follows : \"In determining the validity of this contention (relating to the temporary permit and estoppel arising therefrom) the circumstances under which these applications were made and the legal implications of such applications and the permissions granted under 31 them will have to be considered.\\r\\nIt is remote from our intention to express any opinion in this summary proceeding as to the respective merits of the rival contentions.\\r\\nI am however satisfied that in the context of events and in the logic of circumstances attending thereto there is a case to be tried.\\r\\n\" He next considered the scope of the writ of mandamus and came to the conclusion that \"at the moment\" the respondents had no alternative legal remedy, equally conven ient, beneficial and effectual because the respondents could not file a suit till after the expiry of the period of sixty days required for the purpose under section 80 of the Civil Procedure Code and he thought that unless protected by the Court in the meanwhile the respondents would undergo irrepa rable and irremediable loss of possession of the mining leases involving a huge waste of labour, machinery and other resources of equipments of immense value hardly capable of being remedied by payments of money as compensation.\\r\\nThe Bench therefore passed an order dated 2nd August, 1951, as follows : \"We direct that till three months from today or one week after the institution of their (respondents \\') contemplated suit, whichever is earlier, the Government of the State of Orissa should refrain from disturbing the petitioners \\' possession over the mining areas in question and that thereafter this order will cease to have effect.\\r\\n\" They gave further directions as to how the mines were to be worked during the aforesaid period.\\r\\nTowards the end of the judgment it was stated, \"In the result, the petitions are allowed in part to the limited extent indicated above.\" Narasimham J. agreed with the order set out in the judgment of the Chief Justice although his judgment shows the concur rence to be very halting.\\r\\nHe stated that although he was reluctant to exercise the powers under article 226 because the present respondents could file a suit, yet as in view of section 80 of the Civil Procedure Code there would be an unavoidable delay resulting in irreparable loss to the respondents he agreed that the order should be passed as mentioned in the judgment of the Chief Justice, 32 Towards the end of his judgment he stated as follows: \"It should however be clearly emphasized that the observations contained in this judgment should not be taken as pre judg ing any question which may.arise for the consideration of the Civil Court in the event of the petitioners filing a regular suit and seeking interim relief from that Court by way of temporary injunction, appointment of receiver or otherwise.\\r\\nIf such an application is made, the questions as to whether the petitioners have a prima facie case for trial or whether such a suit is maintainable or whether the bal ance of convenience requires that they should be permitted to remain in possession of the leasehold property till the termination of the suit and other allied matters should all be dealt with by the Court concerned without being influ enced in any way by the observations contained in this judgment.\\r\\nThose observations have been made for the limited purpose of granting temporary relief under article 226 and are not intended to embarrass either party or the Court in future litigation.\\r\\n\" It appears that thereafter an application was made to stay the operation of this order to enable the Government of Orissa to appeal against the order of the 2nd of August.\\r\\nThe same Judges on the 6th of August stayed the operation of the order for fifteen days and observed as follows : \"The effect of the order (of 2nd August, 1951) is that except giving them (respondents in these appeals) some interim measure of relief for the period during which the petition ers were without remedy, we were not inclined to accept the petition and issue a writ in the nature of mandamus, as prayed for.\\r\\n\" The State of Orissa has come on appeal to us and after hearing the arguments on both sides we came to the conclusion that the order of the High Court could not be sustained.\\r\\nWe accordingly passed the following order on the 15th of October: \"These five appeals are allowed and the order of the High Court is set aside in each case.\\r\\nAs the High Court has passed no other orders on the petitions.\\r\\nand indeed has stated that the Court was not prepared to 33 pass any ,other orders on the petitions, the petitions stand dismissed.\\r\\nThe respondents will pay the costs of the ap peals.\\r\\nWe shall give our reasons later on.\\r\\n\" Our reasons are these: Article ,226 of the Constitution of India runs as fol lows: 226.\\r\\n(1)\"Notwithstanding anything in article 32, every High Court shall have power, throughout the territories in relation to which it exercises jurisdiction, to issue to any person or authority, including in appropriate cases any Government, within those territories directions, orders or writs, including writs in the nature of habeas corpus, mandamus, prohibition, quo warranto and certiorari, or any of them, for the enforcement of any of the rights conferred by Part III and for any other purpose.\\r\\n(2) The power conferred on a High Court by clause (1) shall not be in derogation of the power conferred on the Supreme Court by clause (2) of article The language of the Article shows that the issuing of writs or directions by the Court is not rounded only on its decision that a right of the aggrieved party under Part II1 of the Constitution (Fundamental Rights) has been in fringed.\\r\\nIt can also issue writs or give similar directions for any other purpose.\\r\\nThe concluding words of article 226 have to be read in the context of what precedes the same.\\r\\nTherefore the existence of the right is the foundation of the exercise of jurisdiction of the Court under this Arti cle.\\r\\nThe judgment of the Orissa High Court under appeal, however, shows that the Judges have decided nothing at all in respect of the rights of the parties.\\r\\nIndeed they have expressly stated that their observations should not in any way be considered as deciding any of the rights or conten tions of the parties raised in the petitions.\\r\\nThe whole judgment shows that because of the requirement of section 80 of the Civil Procedure Code the present respondents could not file a suit against the Government for at least sixty days, the 5 34 respondent \\'s position should not in the interval be dis turbed and accordingly the Court gave the directions in its order of the 2nd of August, 1951.\\r\\nIf there was any doubt about the nature of the relief desired to be granted by the order of 2nd August the same Judges have made it per fectly clear by their order of the 6th of August, wherein they have stated that except for these directions they were not prepared to make any other order on the petitions.\\r\\nThe result therefore is that while the Judges declined to inves tigate and pronounce on the rights of the parties and ex pressly kept the determination thereof in abeyance in the suit proposed to be filed by the present respondents, they gave directions for interim relief till such suit was filed.\\r\\nIt must be noted that with the passing of the order of the 2nd August, 1951, containing directions in the nature of interim relief the petitions were completely disposed of and have not been kept pending for disposal.\\r\\nThose directions embody therefore the final order passed by the Court on these petitions.\\r\\nA preliminary objection was raised about the maintainability of the appeals on the ground that no final orders were passed on the petitions.\\r\\nThat objection must fail in view of the fact that with these orders the petitions were disposed of finally and nothing further remained to be done in respect of the petitions.\\r\\nThe fact that the operation of the order is limited to three months or a week after the filing of the intended suit does not prevent the order from being final.\\r\\nOn behalf of the appellant it was urged that the Court had no jurisdiction to pass such orders under article 226 under the circumstances of the case.\\r\\nThis is not a case where the Court before finally disposing of a petition under article 226 gave directions in the nature of interim relief for the purpose of maintaining the status quo.\\r\\n, The question which we have to determine is whether directions in the nature of interim relief only could be granted under article 226, when the Court expressly stated that it refrained from determining the rights of the parties on which a writ 35 of mandamus or directions of a like nature could be issued.\\r\\nIn our opinion, article 226 cannot be used for the purpose of giving interim relief as the only and final relief on the application as the High Court has purported to do.\\r\\nThe directions have been given here only to circumvent the provisions of section 80 of the Civil Procedure Code, and in our opinion that is not within the scope of article 226.\\r\\nAn interim relief can be granted only in aid of and as ancil lary to the main relief which may be available to the party on final determination of his rights in a suit or proceed ing.\\r\\nIf the Court was of opinion that there \\' was no other convenient or adequate remedy open to the petitioners, it might have proceeded to investigate the case on its merits and come to a decision as to whether the petitioners suc ceeded in establishing that there was an infringement of any of their legal rights which entitled them to a writ of mandamus or any other directions of a like nature; and pending such determination it might have made a suitable interim order for maintaining the status quo ante.\\r\\nBut when the Court declined to decide on the rights of the parties and expressly held that they should be investigated more properly in a civil suit, it could not, for the purpose of facilitating the institution of such suit, issue directions in the nature of temporary injunctions, under article 226 of the Constitution.\\r\\nIn our opinion, the language of article 226 does not permit such an action.\\r\\nOn that short ground the judgment of the Orissa High Court under appeal cannot be upheld.\\r\\nAppeals allowed.\\r\\nAgent for the appellant in all the appeals: P.A. Mehta.\\r\\nAgent for the respondent in Case No. 300 : S.P. Varma.\\r\\nAgent for the respondent in Cases Nos. 301 and 304: Ganpat Rai.\\r\\nAgent for the respondent in Cases Nos. 302 and 303: P.K.

Daphtary (N. C. Shah, with him) for the appellant.\\r\\nRajani Patel for the respondent.\\r\\nMarch 7.\\r\\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by MUKHERJEA J.\\r\\nThis appeal is on behalf of the defendant and it arises out of a suit, under section 92 of the Civil Procedure Code, commenced by the plaintiffs who were origi nally nine in number in the court of the District Judge of Kaira at Nadiad.\\r\\nOut of the nine plaintiffs, only one is surviving, and he is now the sole respondent in this appeal, all the rest having died pending this protracted litigation, which began as early as the year 1928.\\r\\nThe case of the plaintiffs, in substance, was that one Kuberdas, who was a religious teacher and a holy man rounded a cult known as Kaivalya or Karunasagar Panth, the principal tenet of which is that the realization of the Infinite is possible only through the medium of a Guru or spiritual preceptor.\\r\\nKuberdas received money and lands from his followers and disciples and with this fund he built a temple at Sarsa.\\r\\nKuberdas by will appointed his principal disciple Narayandas to succeed him on the Gadi and Narayandas built another and a bigger temple wherein he installed an image of Kuberdas, with the images of two staff bearers on two sides.\\r\\nThe Mahants after Narayandas were Baldevdas, Bhagwandas and Pragdasji, who is the defendant in the suit and each one of them was appointed by a will executed by his predecessor.\\r\\nThe defendant, it is alleged, had been acting in a manner contrary to the usages of the institution and was guilty of incontinence, mismanagement and improper alienation of trust properties.\\r\\nOn these allegations the plaintiffs prayed that: (1) the properties described in the schedule to the plaint as well as other properties under the management of the defendant be declared to be religious and charitable trust properties of the Kaivalya or Karuna sagar Panth; 515 (2) the defendant be removed from the Gadi and posses sion of the properties and a suitable successor appointed in his place; (3) the defendant be called upon to render accounts for the period of his management; and (4) a scheme might be framed for proper management of the institution.\\r\\nThe defendant in his written statement traversed all the material allegations in the plaint and contended infer alia that the suit was not maintainable inasmuch as no public trust of a religious and charitable character existed in respect to the suit properties which were the private properties of the defendant himself.\\r\\nOn these pleadings, a number of issues were framed by the District Judge, of which the two following were tried as preliminary issues, viz., (1) Whether the temple and the properties in suit are public charitable properties ? and (2) if not, whether this court has jurisdiction to try the suit ? By his judgment dated the 18th of July, 1935, the Dis trict Judge decided both these issues against the plaintiffs and dismissed the suit.\\r\\nAgainst this decision the plain tiffs took an appeal to the High Court of Bombay.\\r\\nThe learned Judges of the High Court, who heard the appeal, took the view that the ownership of.\\r\\nthe suit properties was so restricted by the obligation to maintain the institu tion for purposes which only could be described as public charitable purposes, that the suit must be regarded as one coming within section 92, Civil Procedure Code.\\r\\nThe result was that the judgment of the trial court was reversed and the case was remanded to that court in order that it might be heard and disposed of on its merits.\\r\\nThe judgment of the High Court is dated 24th of January, 1938.\\r\\nBeing aggrieved by this order, the defendant prayed leave to appeal to the Judicial Committee, but this application was refused.\\r\\nHe thereupon filed a petition before the privy Council praying for special leave.\\r\\n516 The Privy Council also refused to grant leave on the ground that the matter was still then in an interlocutory stage.\\r\\nThey, however, said specifically that the order of refusal was without prejudice to the presentation of a fresh peti tion after all the issues were determined.\\r\\nThe case then went back to the trial court and on the evidence adduced by the parties, the District Judge came to the conclusion that the allegations of misconduct and breach of trust made by the plaintiffs were not proved and in this view he dismissed the suit, subject to the declaration already given by the High Court that the temple and the properties in possession of the defendant were public, religious and charitable properties.\\r\\nThe plaintiffs filed an appeal against this decision to the High Court of Bombay and the High Court by its judgment dated 14th of July, 1947, affirmed the decision of the District Judge and dismissed the appeal.\\r\\nThe defendant has now come up to this court on the strength of a certificate granted by the High Court; and though formally it is an appeal against the final decree made by the High Court on 14th of July, 1947, in substance it challenges the propriety of the order of remand passed on 24th January, 1938, by which the High Court reversed the decree of dismissal made by the District Judge and remanded the case, being of opinion that the properties in dispute did appertain to a public trust of a religious and charita ble character.\\r\\nMr. Daphtary appearing in support of the appeal has contended before us that on the question as to whether or not a public trust existed in respect of the properties in suit, the view taken by the trial judge was right and that the decision of the High Court is based upon a misapprecia tion of the evidence on the record.\\r\\nWe have been taken through the entire evidence by the learned counsel on both sides; but having regard to the view which we propose to take in this case we deem it unnecessary to record any finding as to whether the properties in suit do or do not appertain to a public charitable trust.\\r\\nIn our opinion, after the 517 decision arrived at concurrently, by both the courts below on the merits of the case, it was beyond the scope of a suit framed under section 92, Civil Procedure Code, to give the plaintiffs a bare declaration of this character and make it a part of the decree, although the suit itself was dis missed.\\r\\nA suit under section 92, Civil Procedure Code, is a suit of a special nature which presupposes the existence of a public trust of a religious or charitable character.\\r\\nSuch suit can proceed only on the allegation that there is a breach of such trust or that directions from the court are necessary for the administration thereof, and it must pray for one or other of the reliefs that are specifically men tioned in the section.\\r\\nIt is only when these conditions are fulfilled that the suit has got to be brought in conformity with the provision of section 92, Civil Procedure Code.\\r\\nAs was observed by the Privy Council in Abdur Rahim vs Barkat Ali(1), a suit for a declaration that certain property appertains to a religious trust may lie under the general law but is outside the scope of section 92, Civil Procedure Code.\\r\\nIn the case before us, the prayers made in the plaint are undoubtedly appropriate to the terms of section 92 and the suit proceeded on the footing that the defendant, who was alleged to be the trustee in respect of a public trust, was guilty of breach of trust.\\r\\nThe defendant denied the existence of the trust and denied further that he was guilty of misconduct or breach of trust.\\r\\nThe denial could not certainly oust the jurisdiction of the court, but when the courts found concurrently, on the evidence adduced by the parties, that the allegations of breach of trust were not made out, and as it was not the case of the plaintiffs, that any direction of the court was necessary for proper adminis tration of the trust, the very foundation of a suit under section 92, Civil Procedure Code, became wanting and the plaintiffs had absolutely no cause of action for the suit they instituted.\\r\\nIn these circumstances, the finding of the High Court about the existence of a public trust was wholly inconsequential and as it was (1) (1928) 55 I.A. 96, 67 518 unconnected with the grounds upon which the case was actual ly disposed of, it could not be made a part of the decree or the final order in the shape of a declaratory relief in favour of the plaintiffs.\\r\\nIt has been argued by the learned counsel for the respondents that even if the plaintiffs failed to prove the other allegations made in the plaint, they did succeed in proving that the properties were public and charitable trust properties a fact which the defendant denied.\\r\\nIn these circumstances, there was nothing wrong for the court to give the plaintiffs a lesser relief than what they actually claimed.\\r\\nThe reply to this is, that in a suit framed under section 92 of the Civil Procedure Code the only reliefs which the plaintiff can Claim and the court can grant are those enumerated specifically in the different clauses of t, he section.\\r\\nA relief praying for a declaration that the properties in suit are trust properties does not come under any of these clauses.\\r\\nWhen the defendant denies the existence of a trust, a declaration that the trust does exist might be made as ancillary to the main relief claimed under the section if the plaintiff is held entitled to it; but when the case of the plaintiff fails for want of a cause of action, there is no warrant for giving him a declaratory relief under the provision of section 92, Civil Procedure Code.\\r\\nThe finding as to the existence of a public trust in such circumstances would be no more than an obiter dictum and cannot constitute the final decision in the suit.\\r\\nThe result is that in our ' opinion the decision of the High Court should stand, but the decree and the concluding por tion, of the judgment passed by the trial court and affirmed by the High Court on appeal shall direct a ' dismissal of the plaintiff 's suit merely without its being made subject to any declaration as to the character of the properties.\\r\\nTo this extent the appeal is allowed and the final decree modified.\\r\\nThe order for costs made by the courts below will stand.\\r\\nEach party will bear his own costs in this appeal.\\r\\n\", {'entities': [[0, 28, 'CASE_NUMBER'], [71, 105, 'COURT'], [107, 117, 'JUDGE'], [122, 130, 'JUDGE'], [138, 153, 'DATE'], [164, 186, 'CASE_NUMBER'], [212, 230, 'DATE'], [271, 276, 'GPE'], [280, 286, 'GPE'], [290, 321, 'CASE_NUMBER'], [322, 335, 'PETITIONER'], [337, 347, 'LAWYER'], [379, 391, 'RESPONDENT'], [413, 421, 'DATE'], [466, 478, 'JUDGE'], [557, 567, 'PROVISION'], [699, 704, 'GPE'], [708, 715, 'GPE'], [912, 917, 'DATE'], [3150, 3168, 'DATE'], [3324, 3345, 'COURT'], [3656, 3666, 'PROVISION'], [3900, 3922, 'DATE'], [4920, 4940, 'COURT'], [4982, 5000, 'DATE'], [5264, 5282, 'DATE'], [5358, 5376, 'DATE'], [5608, 5620, 'PETITIONER'], [6384, 6394, 'PROVISION'], [6567, 6577, 'PROVISION'], [7102, 7112, 'PROVISION'], [7160, 7202, 'PRECEDENT'], [7344, 7354, 'PROVISION'], [7477, 7487, 'PROVISION'], [8138, 8148, 'PROVISION'], [8415, 8433, 'OTHERS'], [9099, 9109, 'PROVISION'], [9277, 9288, 'PROVISION'], [9770, 9780, 'PROVISION']]}]\n",

Mukherjee, for the appellant.\\r\\nB. Sen, for the respondent.\\r\\nDecember 14.\\r\\nThe Judgment of the Court was deliv ered by FAZL ALI J.\\r\\nThis is an appeal against the judgment of the High Court at Calcutta upholding the order of the Ses sions Judge of Midnapore convicting the appellant under section 326 of the Indian Penal Code and sentencing him to 3 years \\' rigorous imprisonment.\\r\\nThe prosecution case against the appellant may be short ly stated as follows: The appellant and the injured person, Kurnad Patra, are first cousins, and they live in a village called Andaria, their houses being only 3 or 4 cubits apart from each other.\\r\\nThey had a dispute about a pathway adjoin ing their houses, which led to a tank, and they quarrelled about it on the 11th July, 1949.\\r\\nTwo days later, on the lath July, when Kumad Patra was washing his hands at the brink of the village tank, the appellant came from behind and inflicted on him 17 injuries.\\r\\nwith the result that two of his fingers had to be amputated and a piece of bone had to be extracted from his left thumb.\\r\\nThe police being informed, started investigation and submitted a charge sheet against the appellant who was finally committed to the Court of Sessions and tried by the Sessions Judge and a jury.\\r\\nHe was charged under section 307 of the Indian Penal Code, but the jury returned a verdict of guilty against him under section 326 of the Penal Code, and the learned Sessions Judge accepting the verdict convicted him under that section as aforesaid.\\r\\nWhen the matter came up in appeal to the High Court, a rule was issued on the appellant calling upon him to show cause why his sentence 204 should not be enhanced, but, at the final hearing, the rule was discharged, his appeal was dismissed, and his conviction and the original sentence were upheld.\\r\\nThe first point urged on behalf of the appellant before us is that, inasmuch as there was no charge under section 326 of the Penal Code and the offence under that section was not a minor offence with reference to an offence under section 307 of the Code, he could not have been convicted under the former section.\\r\\nThis argument however overlooks the provisions of section 237 of the Criminal Procedure Code.\\r\\nThat section, after referring to section 236 which provides that alternative charges may be drawn up against an accused person where it is doubtful which of several of fences the facts which can be proved will constitute, states as follows : \"If . . the accused is charged with one offence, and it appears in evidence that he committed a different offence for which he might have been charged under the provisions of that section, he may be convicted of the offence which he is shown to have committed, although he was not charged with it.\\r\\n\" There can be no doubt that on the facts of this case, it was open to the Sessions Judge to charge the appellant alternatively under sections 307 and 326 of the Penal Code.\\r\\nThe case therefore clearly falls under section 237 of the Criminal Procedure Code and the appellant \\'s conviction under section 326 of the Penal Code was proper even in the absence of a charge.\\r\\nIn Begu vs The King Emperor (1) the Privy Council had to deal with a case where certain persons were charged under section 302 of the Penal Code, but were convicted under section 201 for causing the disappearance of evidence.\\r\\nTheir Lordships upheld the conviction, and while referring to section 237 of the Criminal Procedure Code, they ob served: \"A man may be convicted of an offence, although there has been no charge in respect of it, if the evidence is such as to establish a charge that might have (1) (1925) 52 I.A. 191, 205 been made .\\r\\nTheir Lordships entertain no doubt that the procedure was a proper procedure and one warranted by the Code of Criminal Procedure.\\r\\n\" The second point urged on behalf of the appellant is that the High Court having issued a rule for the enhancement of the sentence, he should have been allowed to argue the merits of the case which he was not allowed to do.\\r\\nThe learned counsel for the appellant was not, however, able to show that even if it was open to him to argue on the merits of the case the decision would have been otherwise.\\r\\nOnly three contentions were put forward by him, these being : (1) that several material witnesses were not examined; (2.) that the appellant \\'s case was not placed before the jury in a fair manner; and (3) that there was no proper examination of the appel lant under section 342 of the Criminal Procedure Code.\\r\\nWe have examined these contentions and find that they are entirely without merit.\\r\\nIn urging his first contention, the learned counsel stated that though it was admitted that several persons have got houses to the east, north and north west of the tank where the occurrence is alleged to have taken place, they have not been examined by the prose cution.\\r\\nHe further argued that one Sarat Chandra Ghose, who was present at the house of the accused when it was searched, has also not been examined.\\r\\nThese arguments however have very little force, since there is no evidence to show that those persons had seen the occurrence, an d they also do not take note of the fact that such evidence as has been adduced by the prosecution, if believed, was suffi cient to support the conviction of the appellant.\\r\\nThe Ses sions Judge in his charge to the jury referred specifically to the very argument urged before us, and he told \\'the jurors that if they thought it fit it was open to them to draw an inference against the prosecution.\\r\\nThere can be no doubt that the jurors were 27 206 properly directed on the point and they evidently thought that the evidence before them was sufficient for convicting the appellant.\\r\\nThe second contention urged on behalf of the appellant relates to his defence, which, briefly stated, was that Kumad Patra, the injured man, entered his house during his temporary absence, went to the bedroom of his wife, who was a young lady, and committed indecent assault on her and was assaulted in these circumstances.\\r\\nThis story was not sup ported by any evidence but was merely suggested in cross examination, and the Sessions Judge while referring to it in his charge to the jury, observed: \\' \\'If I were left alone, I would not have believed the defence version.\\r\\nBut you are not bound to accept my opin ion, nor you should be influenced by it It is for you to decide whether you will accept the defence suggestion in favour of which there is no such positive evidence.\\r\\n\" The Sessions Judge undoubtedly expressed himself some what strongly with regard to the defence suggestion, but he coupled his observations, which we think he was entitled to make, with an adequate warning to the jurors that they were not bound to accept his opinion and should not be influenced by it.\\r\\nThe defence version was rejected by the jury, and there can be no doubt that on the materials on the record it would have been rejected by any court of fact.\\r\\nThe last contention put forward by the learned counsel for the appellant was that he was not examined as required by law under section 342 of the Criminal Procedure Code.\\r\\nIt appears that three questions ware put to the appellant by the Sessions Judge after the conclusion of the prosecution evidence.\\r\\nIn the first question, the Sessions Judge asked the appellant what his defence was as to the evidence ad duced, against him; in the second question, the Judge re ferred to the dispute about the pathway and asked the appel lant whether he had inflicted injuries on Kumad Patra; and in the third question, the appellant was asked.\\r\\n207 whether he would adduce any evidence.\\r\\nThe facts of the case being free from any complications and the points in issue being simple, we find it difficult to hold that the examina tion of the appellant in this particular case was not ade quate.\\r\\nTo sustain such an argument as has been put forward, it is not sufficient for the accused merely to show that he has not been fully examined as required by section 342 of the Criminal Procedure Code, but he must also show that such examination has materially prejudiced him.\\r\\nIn the present case, it appears that the point urged here was not raised in the grounds of appeal to the High Court, nor does it find a place in the grounds of appeal or in the statement of case filed in this court.\\r\\nIt has nowhere been stated that the accused was in any way prejudiced, and there are no materi als before us to hold that he was or might have been preju diced.\\r\\nWe have read the Sessions Judge \\'s charge to the jury, which is a very fair and full charge, and nothing has been shown to us to justify the conclusion that the verdict of the jury should not have been accepted.\\r\\nThe appeal accordingly fails and is dismissed.\\r\\nAppeal dismissed.\\r\\n', {'entities': [[12, 34, 'CASE_NUMBER'], [78, 100, 'COURT'], [102, 128, 'JUDGE'], [130, 151, 'DATE'], [165, 186, 'CASE_NUMBER'], [191, 216, 'PRECEDENT'], [218, 232, 'PETITIONER'], [254, 260, 'RESPONDENT'], [283, 295, 'DATE'], [341, 352, 'JUDGE'], [400, 422, 'COURT'], [510, 546, 'PROVISION'], [786, 793, 'ORG'], [909, 915, 'ORG'], [932, 936, 'OTHERS'], [974, 990, 'DATE'], [1085, 1097, 'OTHERS'], [1504, 1540, 'PROVISION'], [1602, 1631, 'PROVISION'], [1775, 1785, 'COURT'], [2135, 2170, 'PROVISION'], [2265, 2276, 'PROVISION'], [2400, 2427, 'PROVISION'], [2478, 2489, 'PROVISION'], [3120, 3159, 'PROVISION'], [3200, 3242, 'PROVISION'], [3281, 3310, 'PROVISION'], [3471, 3500, 'PROVISION'], [3527, 3538, 'PROVISION'], [3645, 3687, 'PROVISION'], [4097, 4107, 'COURT'], [4703, 4714, 'PROVISION'], [4962, 4966, 'OTHERS'], [4968, 4973, 'OTHERS'], [4996, 5000, 'OTHERS'], [5131, 5150, 'OTHERS'], [6192, 6202, 'OTHERS'], [7331, 7342, 'PROVISION'], [8242, 8284, 'PROVISION'], [8467, 8477, 'COURT']]}]\n",

C \\'.\\r\\nSen, with him) for the appel lants.\\r\\nC.K. Daphtary (K. B. Asthana, with him) for the re spondents.\\r\\nOctober 20.\\r\\nThe Judgment of the Court was deliv ered by BHAGWATI J.\\r\\nThis is an appeal by the heirs and legal representatives of the deceased plaintiff against the decree of the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad allowing \\' the appeal of the defendants against the decree passed by the Court of the Civil Judge of Shahjahanpur in favour of the plaintiff allowing the plaintiff \\'s claim in part.\\r\\nOne Kailashi Nath Kapoor, the plaintiff, was employed by the District Board of Shahjahanpur, the defendants, as their Secretary in the year 1924.\\r\\nHe 1124 was also entrusted in 1929 with the additional duties of doing assessment work for the defendants.\\r\\nThe work done by the plaintiff did not find favour with some members of the Board and on the 9th November, 1939, six members of the Board tabled a resolution asking the Chairman to convene a special meeting of the Board to consider a resolution for the dismissal of the plaintiff.\\r\\nA special meeting of the Board was convened on the 17th December, 1939.\\r\\nTwelve charges were framed against the plaintiff and he was re quired to furnish his answers to them.\\r\\nA special meeting of the Board was thereafter convened on the 20th January, 1940.\\r\\nThe resolution for the dismissal of the plaintiff was on the agenda but the meeting had to be adjourned for want of quorum to the 29th January, 1940.\\r\\nAt the adjourned meeting of the 29th January, 1940, twenty five out of the twentyseven members of the Board were present.\\r\\nThe charges against the plaintiff were gone into and eleven out of the twelve charges were held proved.\\r\\nTwo resolutions were consequently passed by the Board at this meeting, one being a resolution for his dismissal, and the other being a reso lution for his suspension till the matter of his dismissal was decided under section 71 of the U.P. District Boards Act, X of 1922, on an appeal if any preferred by the plain tiff to the Government.\\r\\nThe plaintiff preferred an appeal to the Government against the resolution for his dismissal and this appeal was dismissed by the Government on the 19th December, 1940.\\r\\nThe plaintiff thereafter commenced in the Court of the Civil Judge at Shahjahanpur the suit out of which this appeal arises against the defendants for a declaration that the two resolutions passed by the Board on the 29th January, 1940, were illegal and ullra vires of the Board and that he continued to be the Secretary and Assessing Officer of the Board, for an injunction restraining the Board from prevent ing him from discharging his duties as such Secretary and Assessing Officer, for arrears of his salary with interest and contribution to his provident Fund and in the alterna tive 1125 for damages and compensation for illegal dismissal and suspension and for costs.\\r\\nThe defendants contended that the said resolutions were valid and binding on the plaintiff and that the plaintiff was not entitled to any relief as claimed.\\r\\nThe learned trial judge held that the two resolutions passed by the Board on the 29th January, 1940, were properly passed and that there was no irregularity in the procedure.\\r\\nHe held that the resolution for dismissal of the plaintiff was valid and binding on the plaintiff but the resolution for suspension was not legal.\\r\\nIn the result he decreed the plaintiff \\'s claim for arrears of salary, and the contribu tion towards the provident fund against the defendants for the period of suspension and awarded to the plaintiff a sum of Rs. 6,629 4 0 with proportionate costs, the rest of the plaintiff \\'s claim was dismissed.\\r\\nThe defendants appealed to the High Court against this decree and the plaintiff filed cross objections in regard to his claim which had been disallowed.\\r\\nThe plaintiff died during the pendency of the appeal and his heirs and legal representatives, being his widow and his four sons, were brought on the record.\\r\\nThe High Court concurred with the trial court in the finding that there was no irregularity, impropriety or illegality in the procedure followed and the steps taken before the meet ing or at the meeting of the Board when the two resolutions were considered and passed.\\r\\nIt however disagreed with the conclusion reached by the trial Court that the resolution for suspension was ultra vires the Board.\\r\\nIt held that the resolution for suspension also was valid and binding on the plaintiff and thus dismissed the plaintiff \\'s suit with costs throughout.\\r\\nThe crossobjections of the plaintiff were of course dismissed with costs.\\r\\nThe heirs and legal repre sentatives of the plaintiff obtained leave to appeal to the Federal Court against this decision of the High Court and the appeal was admitted on the 5th November, 1948.\\r\\nBoth the Courts below having found that there was no irregularity, impropriety or illegality in the procedure followed and the steps taken when the two 1126 resolutions in question were passed by the Board the only question that survived for consideration by this Court was whether the resolution for suspension of the plaintiff was valid and binding on the plaintiff or in other words whether it was competent to the Board to pass the resolution for the suspension of the plaintiff after it had passed the resolu tion for his dismissal under section 71 of the Act.\\r\\nSection 71 of the Act provides for the dismissal and punishment of the secretary: \"A board may by special resolution punish or dismiss its secretary: Provided, firstly, that such resolution is passed by a vote of not less than two thirds of the total number of members of the board for the time being: Provided, secondly, that the secretary of a board shall have a right of appeal to the State Government against such resolution within one month from the date of the communica tion of the resolution to him, and that the resolution shall not take effect until the period of one month has expired or until the State Government have passed orders on any appeal preferred by him.\\r\\n\" It will be relevant at this stage to note that this section 71 was amended by U.P. Act I of 1933.\\r\\nSection 71 as it originally stood ran thus: \"A board may by special resolution punish or dismiss its secretary provided, (a) that such a resolution is passed by a vote of not less than two thirds of the total number of members of the board for the time being, or (b) that it is passed by a vote of not less than one half of the total number of members.\\r\\nand is \\' sanctioned by the Local Government \\' .\\r\\nIt may be noted that in the original section 71 provi sion was made for the sanction of the Local Government in certain cases.\\r\\nNo such provision is to be found in the amended section 71 of the Act.\\r\\nThe resolution according to the amended section 71 is to be passed by a vote of not less than two thirds of the 1127 total number of members of the Board and such a resolution is not to take effect until the period of one month has expired within which the secretary can exercise his right of appeal or until the Government have passed orders on the appeal if any preferred by him.\\r\\nThere is no question of the sanction of the Local Government to any resolution for dismissal the only provision being that the resolution is to take effect after the expiration of the period of one month or after the Government have passed orders on the appeal if any preferred by the secretary within that period of one month.\\r\\nOnce that period of one month expires without the secretary preferring any appeal against the resolution of the Board or the Government passes final orders on the appeal preferred by him, the resolution takes effect without anything more in the nature of a sanction by the Government.\\r\\nThe power of suspension is conferred and regulated in section 90 of the Act : \"(1) Suspension may be of two kinds: (a) suspension as a punishment, and (b) suspension pending inquiry or orders.\\r\\n(2) Where a general power to punish is conferred by this Act, it shall be deemed to include a power to suspend as a punishment for a period not exceeding three months.\\r\\n(3) Where a power of dismissal, whether subject to the sanction of any other authority or not, is conferred by this Act, it shall be deemed to include a power to suspend any person against whom the power of dismissal might be exer cised, pending enquiry into his conduct or pending the orders of any authority whose sanction is necessary for his dismissal.\\r\\n(4) Where suspension is ordered pending inquiry or or ders, and the officer suspended is ultimately restored, it shall be at the discretion of the authority ordering his suspension whether he shall get any, and, if so what, allow ance during the period of suspension; but in the absence of any order to the contrary he shall be 1128 entitled to the full remuneration which he would have re ceived but for such suspension.\\r\\n\" The suspension which has been thus provided for is of two categories, (1) suspension as a punishment and (2) suspension pending enquiry or orders.\\r\\nIn the case of a suspension falling within the latter category the only power of suspension which is provided is that of suspending any person against whom the power of dismissal might be exer cised pending enquiry into his conduct or pending the orders of any authority whose sanction is necessary for his dis missal.\\r\\nThe power of suspension pending enquiry into the conduct of the person can only be exercised if an enquiry against him has been started and before any order is made for his dismissal as a result of such enquiry.\\r\\nThe power of suspension pending the orders of the authority whose sanc tion is necessary for his dismissal can similarly be exer cised provided the order of dismissal is made but that dismissal could be effective only after the orders of the authority whose sanction is needed for effectuating the same.\\r\\nThe section does not provide for any other case where as on the facts before us the order of dismissal does not require the sanction of any authority but has got to await either the expiry of a particular period after such order of dismissal has been made or the result of an appeal which may be preferred to the Government within the period prescribed in that behalf.\\r\\nA decision of an authority to which an appeal is provided is not the same thing as a sanction by the authority.\\r\\nA perusal of sub section (4) of section 90 makes this position quite clear.\\r\\nThe authority ordering the suspension is vested with the discretion to determine whether the officer suspended would get any or if so what allowance during the period of suspension where suspension is ordered pending enquiry or orders and the officer sus pended is ultimately restored.\\r\\nThere is no provision for any allowance where the officer having been dismissed is also suspended for the period which has of necessity to expire before his appeal is time barred or before the Gov ernment passes 1129 orders on the appeal if any preferred by him within the prescribed period.\\r\\nSuch a case is not at all provided for in sub section 4 of section 90 and the officer so suspended would be without any remedy whatever and would not be able to get any allowance at all from the authority ordering his suspension during such period of suspension.\\r\\nIt is necessary to bear in mind the provisions of these sections 71 and 90 of the Act in order to determine whether it was competent to the Board to pass a resolution for suspension of the plaintiff after it had passed the resolu tion for his dismissal on the 29th January, 1940.\\r\\nOn a construction of these sections 71 and 90 of the Act the trial Court came to the conclusion that the provisions of section 90 of the Act were exhaustive, that no other category of suspension apart from those specified could be ordered and that therefore the resolution for suspension of the plaintiff was ultra rites the Board.\\r\\nThe High Court in appeal realised the difficulty of the position.\\r\\nIt came to the conclusion that section 90 as it stood was in close conformity with the provisions of the old section 71 of the Act which provided for the resolution for dismissal passed by a vote of not less than one half of the total number of members being required to be sanctioned by the Local Govern ment.\\r\\nThe sanction was expressly provided there.\\r\\nBut when that section came to be amended by the U.P. Act I of 1933, the provision for sanction was deleted and it provided for the resolu tion not taking effect until the period of one month had expired within which the secretary could exercise his right of appeal or until the Government had passed orders on the appeal ii any preferred by him.\\r\\nWhen this amendment was made in the old section 71 of the Act the provision made in section 90 in regard to the power of suspension was lost sight of and no corresponding amendment was made in section 90, sub section (1)(b), sub section (3) or subsection (4) which would bring the provisions of 145 1130 section 90 in conformity with the amended section 71 of the Act.\\r\\nThe High Court was therefore at pains to place what it called a liberal construction on the provisions of section 71 and section 90 of the Act trying to read in the power of suspension provided in section 90 also a power of suspension during the period that the secretary preferred an appeal to the Government against the order of his dismissal and the Government passed orders on such appeal.\\r\\nApart from placing this so called liberal construction on the expression \"the orders of any authority whose sanc tion is necesssary\" in section 90 subsection 3, the High Court also brought to its aid the provisions of Section 16 of the U.P. General Clauses Act of 1904 which provides that \"unless a different intention appears the authority having power to make the appointment shall also have power to suspend or dismiss any person appointed by it in exercise of that power \".\\r\\nIt came to the conclusion that nothing in the terms of section 71 or section 90 of the Act controlled or negatived an intention to sustain the general power of suspension, i.e. suspension pending orders on an appeal.\\r\\nThe High Court thus justified the resolution for the suspen sion of the plaintiff passed by the Board on the 29th January, 1940.\\r\\nWe are afraid we cannot agree with this line of reason ing adopted by the High Court.\\r\\nThe defendants were a Board created by statute and were invested with powers which of necessity had to be found within the four corners of the statute itself.\\r\\nThe powers of dismissal and suspension given to the Board are defined and circumscribed by the provisions of sections 71 and 90 of the Act and have to be culled out from the express provisions of those sections.\\r\\nWhen express powers have been given to the Board under the terms of these sections it would not be legitimate to have resort to general or implied powers under the law of master and servant or under section 16 of the U.P. General Clauses Act.\\r\\nEven under the terms of section 16 of that Act, the powers which are vested 1131 in the authority to suspend or dismiss any person appointed are to be operative only \"unless a different intention appears\" and such different intention is to be found in the enactment of sections 71 and 90 of the Act which codify the powers of dismissal and suspension vested in the Board.\\r\\nIt would be an unwarranted extension of the powers of suspen sion vested in the Board to read, as the High Court pur ported to do, the power of suspension of the type in ques tion into the words \"the orders of any authority whose sanction is necessary\".\\r\\nIt was unfortunate that when the Legislature came to amend the old section 71 of the Act it forgot to amend section90 in conformity with the amendment of section 71.\\r\\nBut this lacuna cannot be supplied by any such liberal construction as the High Court sought to put upon the expression \"orders of any authority whose sanction is necessary\".\\r\\nNo doubt it is the duty of the court to try to harmonise the various provisions of an Act passed by the Legislature.\\r\\nBut it is certainly not the duty of the Court to stretch the words used by the Legislature to fill in gaps or omissions in the provisions of an Act.\\r\\nReading the present, section 71 of the Act along with section 90 of the Act we are of the opinion that the power of suspension of the nature purported to be exercised by the Board in the case before us was not the power of suspension contemplated in section 90 sub section (3) of the Act.\\r\\nIf the plaintiff allowed the period of one month to expire without preferring an appeal against the resolution to the Government or if the Government passed orders dismissing his appeal, if any, the resolution for \\' his dismissal would become effective without any sanction of the Government.\\r\\nThe words used therefore in section 90, sub section (3) \"pending the orders of any authority whose sanction is necessary for his dismissal\" are inappropriate to the present facts and could not cover the case of a suspension of the nature which was resorted to by the Board on the 29th January, 1940.\\r\\nWe are therefore of the view that the resolution for suspension which was 1132 passed on the 29th January, 1940, was ultra vires the powers of the Board.\\r\\nWe have accordingly come to the conclusion that the decision reached by the High Court that the resolution for suspension which was passed by the Board on the 29th Janu ary, 1940, was valid and binding on the \"plaintiff was erroneous and that the conclusion reached by the trial Court was correct.\\r\\nThe learned Solicitor General appearing for the defendants has however informed us that the sum of Rs. 6,629 4 0 and the proportionate costs which were awarded by the trial Court to the plaintiff have already been paid to the plaintiff.\\r\\nNothing therefore remains to be recovered by the heirs and legal representatives of the plaintiff even on the basis that the decree of the trial Court is restored as a result of this judgment of ours.\\r\\nThe only thing which therefore survives is the question of the costs of this appeal.\\r\\nThe trial Court had already awarded to the plaintiff proportionate costs.\\r\\nThe High Court in reversing the judgment of the trial Court dismissed the plaintiff \\'s suit with costs throughout including the costs of the cross objections which were filed by the plain tiff.\\r\\nThe heirs and legal representatives of the plaintiff filed the present appeal in regard to the whole claim of the plaintiff as laid in the plaint.\\r\\nThat claim could not be sustained before us by the heirs and legal representatives of the plaintiff and they only succeeded before us in regard to the claim of the plaintiff which had been allowed by the trial Court.\\r\\nIf an order for proportionate costs of this appeal were made it would certainly work to the prejudice of the heirs and legal representatives of the plaintiff.\\r\\nWe are not disturbing the order which had been made by the High Court in regard to the costs of the appeal before it.\\r\\nNo time was taken up before us in arguing the appeal on other points except the one in regard to the resolution for the suspension of the plaintiff being ultra rites and we think that under the circumstances of the case the proper order to pass in regard to the costs of this appeal before us should be that each party should bear its own costs.\\r\\n1133 The only order which we need pass in this appeal before us under the circumstances is that the appeal is allowed, the decree of the trial court is restored, and each party do bear and pay its own costs of this appeal.\\r\\nAppeal allowed.\\r\\n', {'entities': [[6, 29, 'CASE_NUMBER'], [77, 97, 'DATE'], [106, 130, 'COURT'], [134, 143, 'GPE'], [145, 154, 'JUDGE'], [159, 168, 'JUDGE'], [179, 201, 'CASE_NUMBER'], [247, 264,

Aggarwal for the respondents.\\r\\nFebruary 27.\\r\\nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered by DAs J.\\r\\nThis is an application under article 32 of the Constitution made by Mohammad Yasin for the protection of his fundamental right of carrying on his business which, according to him, is being infringed by the respondent.\\r\\nThe case sought to be made out in the petition may be shortly stated as follows: The petitioner is a wholesale dealer in fresh vegetables and fruits at Jalalabad in the district of Muzaffarnagar in the State of Uttar Pradesh and claims to have been carrying on such business for the last 7 years or so at his shop situated in the town of Jalalabad.\\r\\nThe vegetable and fruit growers used to bring their goods to the town and get them auctioned through any of the vegetable dealers of their choice who used to charge one anna in the rupee as and by way of commission.\\r\\nThe respondent Committee which is a Town Area Committee has framed certain bye laws under which all right and power to levy or collect commission on sale or purchase of vegetables and fruits within the limits of the town vest in the respondent Committee or any other agency appointed by the Committee and no one except the respondent Committee is authorised to deal in wholesale vegetables and fruits and collect the commission thereof in any place and in any event.\\r\\nThe respondent Committee has by auction given the contract for sale of 575 vegetables and fruits and for collecting the commission for the current year to the respondent Bishamber who, it is alleged, has never dealt in vegetables and fruits The respondent Committee has not set up any market nor has it framed any bye laws for issue of licences to the vegetable and fruit merchants.\\r\\nThe bye laws also provide for prosecu tion for the breach of any of the provisions of these bye laws.\\r\\nAlthough, in terms, there is no absolute prohibition against carrying on business as wholesale dealer in vegeta bles and fruits, the result of the bye laws requiring the wholesale dealers to pay the prescribed fee of one anna in the rupee to the contractor who holds the monopoly is, in effect, to bring about a total prohibition of the business of the wholesale dealers in vegetables and fruits.\\r\\nThe petitioner contends that by granting a monopoly of the right to do wholesale business in vegetables and fruits to the respondent Bishamber the respondent Committee has in effect totally prevented the petitioner from carrying on his busi ness and has thereby infringed his fundamental right under article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution.\\r\\nIn the alterna tive, the petitioner contends that the respondent Committee has no legal authority to impose a tax of the kind it has sought to do, that the imposition of a tax calculated at one anna in the rupee is in the nature of a sale tax and cannot be regarded as a licence fee and such unauthorised impost constitutes an illegal restraint on his fundamental right under article 19 (1) (g).\\r\\nThe notice of motion has been served on the respondent Committee as well as on respondent Bishamber.\\r\\nThe respond ents have entered appearance and filed an affidavit in opposition to the present application affirmed by their agent on record Paragraph 4 of that affidavit is as follows : \"4.\\r\\nParagraphs 4, 5, 6 and 7 of the petition are wrong and misleading and do not convey the correct idea.\\r\\nIf the bye laws are read from beginning to end, the correct posi tion is that the Town Area Committee has lawfully imposed certain taxes on the purchase 576 and sale of fruits and vegetables within the ambit of the Town Area; and instead of collecting the aforesaid taxes departmentally the Committee finds it more convenient and less expensive to auction the \\'right to collect the taxes \\' and give the contract to the highest bidder or whomsoever it thinks fit and proper.\\r\\nThere is absolutely no restriction on anybody who wants to purchase or anybody who wants to sell; only he must pay the prescribed tax to the Town Area Commit tee through the Contractor.\\r\\nThe market is open, and writ large throughout the territory of the Town Area Committee and anybody can purchase from anybody and anybody can sell to anybody, without any control or intervention by the Contractor, whose position is simply that of a taxcollector on behalf of the Town Area Committee.\\r\\nInstead of getting the pay, he gets the profits, if any, and runs the risk of incurring losses if his gross realisations are less than what he paid.\\r\\nThis is clearly the position, and it is submitted, there is nothing wrong with it legally and no interference of the petitioner \\'s rights.\\r\\n\" The petitioner has to his petition annexed copies of a set of bye laws dated June 24, 1942, and a copy of a resolu tion of the respondent Committee dated March 16, 1950, recommending the addition of several bye laws to the previ ous bye laws.\\r\\nAt the hearing of the petition before us it was agreed by and between counsel on both sides that the petition has to be disposed of on the basis of the bye laws of 1942 only and learned counsel for the respondent Commit tee has produced the original bye laws of 1942 before us.\\r\\nBye law 1 only provides that no person shall sell or pur chase any vegetable or fruit within the prescribed limits of the Town Area Committee, Jalalabad by wholesale or auction,without paying the fee fixed under these bye laws to the licensee appointed by the Town Magistrate.\\r\\nBye law 4 (b) expressly provides that any person can sell in wholesale at any place in the Town Area provided he pays the pre scribed fees to the licensee.\\r\\nIt is, therefore, clear that these byelaws do not in terms, prohibit anybody from dealing in vegetables and fruits as alleged by the petitioner 577 and in this respect they materially differ from the bye laws which this Court had to consider in the Kairana case(1) which consequently does not govern this case.\\r\\nLearned counsel, however, contends and we think with considerable force and cogency that although, in form, there is no prohibition against carrying on any wholesale business by anybody, in effect and in substance the bye laws have brought about a total stoppage of the wholesale deal ers \\' business in a commercial sense.\\r\\nThe wholesale dealers, who will have to pay the prescribed fee to the contractor appointed by auction, will necessarily have to charge the growers of vegetables and fruits something over and above the prescribed lee so as to keep a margin of profit for themselves but in such circumstances no grower of vegetables and fruits will have his produce sold to or auctioned by the wholesale dealers at a higher rate of commission but all of them will flock to the contractor who will only charge them the prescribed commission.\\r\\nOn the other hand, if the wholesale dealers charge the growers of vegetables and fruits only the commission prescribed by the bye laws they will have to make over the whole of it to the contractor without keeping any profit themselves.\\r\\nIn other words, the wholesale dealers will be converted into mere tax col lectors for the contractor or the respondent Committee without any remuneration from either of them In effect, therefore, the bye laws, it is said, have brought about a total prohibition of the business of the wholesale dealers in a commercial sense and from a practical point of view.\\r\\nWe are not of opinion that this contention is unsound or untenable.\\r\\nLearned counsel for the petitioner, however, does not leave the matter there.\\r\\nHe goes further and urges that the respondent Committee has no legal authority to impose this fee of one anna in the rupee on the value of goods sold or auctioned and that such imposition is in the nature of a sale tax rather than a licence fee.\\r\\n(1) ; 578 Learned counsel for the respondent in reply takes a preliminary objection to this line of argument.\\r\\nHe points out that as the levying of a tax without authority of law is specifically prohibited under article 265 of the Constitu tion, article 81(1) must be construed as referring to depri vation of property otherwise than by levying of a tax and that levying of a tax in contravention of article 265 does not amount to a breach of a fundamental right.\\r\\nHe contends, on the authority of the decision of this Court in Ramjilal vs Income tax Officer, Mohindargarh(1), that while an ille gal imposition of tax may be challenged in a properly con stituted suit, it cannot be questioned by an application under article 32.\\r\\nThis argument overlooks the difference between a tax like the income tax and a licence fee for carrying on a business.\\r\\nA licence fee on a business not only takes away the property of the licensee but also operates as a restriction on his right to carry on his business, for without payment of such fee the business cannot be carried on at all.\\r\\nThis aspect of the matter was not raised or considered in the case relied on by the learned counsel, and that case, therefore, has no application to the facts of this case.\\r\\nUnder article 19(1) (g) the citizen has the right to carry on any occupation, trade or business which right under that clause is apparently to be unfettered.\\r\\nThe only restriction to this unfettered right is the authority of the State to make a law relating to the carrying on of such occupation, trade or business as mentioned in clause (6) of that article as amended by the Constitution (First Amend ment) Act, 1951.\\r\\nIf therefore, the licence fee cannot be justified on the basis of any valid law no question of its reasonableness can arise, for an illegal impost must at all times be an unreasonable restriction and will necessarily infringe the right of the citizen to carry on his occupa tion, trade or business under article 19 (1) (g) and such infringement can properly be made the subject matter of a challenge under article 32 of the Constitution.\\r\\n(1) [1951] S.C.R.127.\\r\\n579 Learned counsel for the respondents then refers us to the U.P. Town Areas Act (No. 11 of 1914) which governs the respondent Committee.\\r\\nSection 14 of this Act requires the Committee to annually determine and report to the District Magistrate the amount required to be raised in any town area for the purposes of this Act and provides that the amount so determined shall be raised by the imposition of a tax to be assessed on the occupiers of houses or lands within the limits of the town area according either to their general circumstances or to the annual rental value of the houses or lands so occupied by them as the Committee may determine.\\r\\nThere were, at the time when the bye laws of the respond ent Committee were framed, five provisos to this section none of which authorised the imposition of any tax on any business and, therefore, they have no bearing on the ques tion now under consideration.\\r\\nLearned counsel for the respondents, however, draws our attention to section 38 of the Act which authorises the Provincial Government by noti fication in the Official Gazette to extend to all or any or any part of any town area any enactment for the time being in force in any municipality in the United Provinces and to declare its extension to be subject to such restrictions and modifications, if any, as it thinks fit.\\r\\nThen he proceeds to draw our attention to Notification No. 397/XI 871 E, dated the 6th February, 1929, whereby, in supersession of all previous notifications, the Provincial Government, in exer cise of the powers conferred by section 38(1) of the United Provinces Town Areas Act, 1914, extended the provisions of sections 293(1) and 298(2) (J) (d) of the United Provinces Municipalities Act (11 of 1916) to all the town area in the United Provinces in the modified form set forth therein.\\r\\nThe original bye laws produced by learned counsel purport, however, to have been framed by the respondent Committee under sections 298 (2)(F)(a)and 294 of the United Provinces Municipalities Act (11 of 1916).\\r\\nWe have not been referred to any notification whereby section \\'294 580 of the United Provinces Municipalities Act was extended to the respondent Committee.\\r\\nIt appears, however, that the bye laws of the respondent Committee were revised in Septem ber 1942 and were then said to have been made under section 298 (2) (J) (d).\\r\\nIt will have, therefore, to be seen wheth er these bye laws come within The purview of section 298 (2) (J) (d) as modified in their application to the respondent Committee.\\r\\nIt will be noticed that under section 298 (2) (J) (d) as modified as aforesaid the respondent Committee is authorised only to make bye laws fixing any charges or fees or any scale of charges or fees to be paid under section 9.93(1) and prescribing the times at which such charges or fees shall be payable and designating the persons authorised to receive payment thereof.\\r\\nSection 293(1), as modified, authorises the respondent Committee to charge fees to be fixed by bye laws or by public auction or by agreement for the use or occupation (otherwise than under a lease) of any immovable property vested in, or entrusted to the management of the Town Area Committee, including any public street or place of which it allows the use or occupation whether by allowing a projection thereon or otherwise.\\r\\nBye law 1 of the respondent Committee to which a reference has already been made forbids a person from using any land within the limits of the town area for the sale or purchase of fruits and vegetables without paying the prescribed fee.\\r\\nBye law 4 (b), however, allows any person to sell in wholesale at any place in the town area, provided he pays the prescribed fees to the licensee.\\r\\nThese bye laws do not purport to fix a fee for the use or occupation of any immovable property vested in or entrusted to the management of the Town Area Committee including any public street or place of which it allows the use or occupation whether by allowing a projection thereon or otherwise.\\r\\nSections 293(1) and 298(2) (J) (d) of the United Province Municipalities Act, 1916, as amended at the time they were extended to the town areas in the United Provinces do not empower the Town Area Committee to make any bye law authorising it to 581 charge any fees otherwise than for the use or occupation of any property vested in or entrusted to the management of the Town Area Committee including any public street.\\r\\nTherefore, the bye laws prima facie go much beyond the powers con ferred on the respondent Committee by the sections men tioned above and the petitioner complains against the en forcement of these bye laws against him as he carries on business in his own shop and not in or on any immoveable property vested in the Town Area Committee or entrusted to their management.\\r\\nLearned counsel for the respondent Commit tee, however, urges that the growers of vegetables and fruits come on foot or in carts or on horses along the public street and stand outside the petitioner \\'s shop and for such use of the public street the respondent Committee is well within its powers to charge the fees.\\r\\nFrom the way the case was formulated by the learned counsel, it is quite clear that if anybody uses the public street it is the growers of vegetables and fruits who come to the petition er \\'s shop to get their produce auctioned by the petitioner and the petitioner cannot be charged with fees for use of the public street by those persons.\\r\\nIn our opinion, the bye laws which impose a charge on the wholesale dealer in the shape of the prescribed fee, irrespective of any use or occupation by him of immoveable property vested in or en trusted to the management of the Town Area Committee includ ing any public street, are obviously ultra vires the powers of the respondent Committee and, therefore, the bye laws cannot be said to constitute a valid law which alone may, under article 19(16) of the Constitution,ofimpose a restric tion on the right conferred by article 19(1) (g).\\r\\nIn the absence of any valid law authorising it, such illegal impo sition must undoubtedly operate as an illegal restraint and must infringe the unfettered right of the wholesale dealer to carry on his occupation, trade or business which is guaranteed to him by article 19(1) (g) of our Constitution 75 582 In this view of the matter the petitioner is entitled to a suitable order for protection of his fundamental right.\\r\\nThe prayer in the petition, however, has been expressed in language much too wide and cannot be granted in that form.\\r\\nThe proper order would be to direct the respondent Committee not to prohibit the petitioner from carrying on the busi ness of a wholesale dealer in vegetables and fruits within the limits of the Jalalabad Town Area Committee until proper and valid bye laws are framed and thereafter except in accordance with a licence to be obtained by the petitioner under the bye laws to be so framed.\\r\\nThe respondent Commit tee will pay the costs of this application to the petition er.\\r\\nAgent for the petitioner: Naunit Lal.\\r\\n', {'entities': [[0, 27, 'CASE_NUMBER'], [34, 64, 'PROVISION'], [153, 168, 'LAWYER'], [190, 203, 'LAWYER'], [226, 238, 'DATE'], [283, 289, 'COURT'], [320, 330,

Sinha and M.Y. Sharif, Nuruddin Ahmad and (Shaukat Hussain, with them) for the appellant.\\r\\nGopal Singh for the respondent.\\r\\nMarch 20.\\r\\nThe Judgment of the court was delivered by BOSE J.\\r\\nThe main question in this case is whether there is a right of private defence.\\r\\nMost of the facts are not in dispute.\\r\\nA communal \\' riot broke out at Katni on the 5th of March, 1950, between some Sindhi refugees resident in the town and the local Muslims.\\r\\nThe trouble started in the locality known as Zanda Bazar or Zanda Chowk.\\r\\nPolice Constable Bharat Singh, P.W. 17, who made the First Information Re port, said that most of the shopkeepers in Zanda Bazar are Sindhis.\\r\\nHe stated that when he was to1d that trouble had broken out there he proceeded to the spot and found that the goods in the Muslim shops in that locality were scattered.\\r\\nIt is also in evidence that some Muslims lost their lives.\\r\\nFrom this place he went on to Subash Chowk, the locality in which the appellant \\'s shop is situate.\\r\\nIt lies to the West of Zanda Bazar.\\r\\nHe states that when he got there he found a \"crowd\" there but not a \"mob\".\\r\\nHe admitted that he had said in the First Information Report that a gun was fired a minute after he had reached the spot and he said that what he had stated in the First Information Report was true.\\r\\nIt is not disputed that this shot was fired by the appellant, as also a second shot, and that that caused the death of one man (a Sindhi) and injured three others, also Sindhis.\\r\\nThe map, exhibit D 4, shows that the shops of the appellant and his brother Zahid Khan run into each other and form two sides of a rectangle, the appellant \\'s house facing north and the brother \\'s house facing east.\\r\\nEach shop opens out on to a road.\\r\\n569 It is proved that when the rioting broke out in the Zanda Chowk the alarm spread to the appellant \\'s locality and the people there, including the appellant, started closing their shops.\\r\\nThe appellant \\'s version is that the mob approached his locality and broke into the portion of the building facing east in which his brother \\'s shop is situate and looted it.\\r\\nThe High Court holds that this is proved and holds further that this preceded the firing by the appellant.\\r\\nThere is a hole in the wall between the two portions of the building in which these two shops are situate and the High Court holds that Zahid \\'s family got into the appel lant \\'s portion of the building through this hole and took refuge there.\\r\\nThe High Court also holds that the appel lant \\'s mother then told the appellant that the crowd had burst into his (appellant \\'s) shop and was looting it.\\r\\nThe learned Judges state that what he said was not quite true because all that the crowd did was to beat the door of the appellant \\'s shop with lathis as they were passing but had not broken into the shop.\\r\\nBut they accept the fact that the crowd was beating the doors of the appellant \\'s shop with their lathis.\\r\\nIn our opinion, the facts found by the High Court are sufficient to afford a right of private defence.\\r\\nUnder section 97 of the indian Penal Code the right extends not only to the defence of one \\'s own body against any offence affecting the human body but also to defending the body of any other person.\\r\\nThe right also embraces the protection of property, whether one \\'s own or another person \\'s, against certain specified offences, namely theft, robbery, mischief and criminal trespass.\\r\\nThe limitations on this right and its scope are set out in the sections which follow.\\r\\nFor one thing, the right does not arise if there is time to have recourse to the protection of the public authorities, and for another, it does not extend to the infliction of more harm than is necessary for the purpose of defence.\\r\\nAnother limitation is that when death is 570 caused the person exercising the right must be under reason able apprehension of death, or grievous hurt, to himself or to those whom he is protecting; and in the case of property, the danger to it must be of the kinds specified in section 103.\\r\\nThe scope of the right is further explained in sec tions 102 and 105 of the Indian Penal Code.\\r\\nNeither the learned High Court Judges nor the Sessions Judge has analysed these provisions.\\r\\nBoth Courts appear to be under the impression that actual looting of the appel lant \\'s shop was necessary before the right could arise.\\r\\nIn that they are wrong.\\r\\nUnder section 102 the right of private defence of the body commences \"As soon as a reasonable apprehension of the danger to the body arises from an attempt or threat to commit the offence though the offence may not have been committed.\\r\\n\" Examining the provisions we have set out above, it is evident that the appellant had no time to have recourse to the authorities.\\r\\nThe mob or crowd had already broken into one part of the building and was actually beating on the doors of the other part.\\r\\nIt is also evident that the appel lant had reasonable grounds for apprehending that either death or grievous hurt would be caused either to himself or his family learned Sessions Judge has eloquently drawn attention to the lamentable consequences of communal frenzy in India and in Katni in particular, and he refers to the indiscriminate looting of Muslim shops in that town.\\r\\nSo also the High Court holds that \" Looking to the circumstances which had existed in the country before and the fact that the trouble was between the refugees and the local Muslims it cannot be said that there would be no danger to the life of the appellant or at least of grievous hurt if the mob had entered his shop and he prevented it.\\r\\nThe apprehension would undoubtedly be reason able.\\r\\n\" And we know that Muslim shops had already been broken into and looted and Muslims killed in the 571 rioting at Zanda Chowk which preceded this, in our opinion, the High Court was wrong in thinking that the appellant had to wait until the mob actually broke into his shop and entered it.\\r\\nThey have emphasised this in another part of their judgment also where they say that the shot was fired \" when there was no looting at the shop and thus no right of private defence.\\r\\n\" It was enough that the mob had actually broken into another part of the house and looted it, that the woman and children of his family fled to the appellant for protection in terror of their lives and that the mob was actually beating at his own doors with their lathis and that Muslim shops had already been looted and Muslims killed in the adjoining locality.\\r\\nIt was impossible for him to know whether his shop would or would not suffer the same fate if he waited, and on the findings it was reasonable for him to apprehend death or grievous hurt to himself and his family once they broke in, for he would then have had the right to protest and indeed would have been bound to do what he could to protect his family.\\r\\nThe threat to break in was implicit in the conduct of the mob and with it the threat to kill or cause grievous hurt to the inmates; indeed the High Court Judges themselves hold that his own shop was menaced.\\r\\nThe circumstances in which he was placed were amply sufficient to give him a right of private defence of the body even to the extent of causing death.\\r\\nThese things cannot be weighed in too fine a set of scales or, as some learned Judges have expressed it, in golden scales.\\r\\nWe have next to see whether the appellant used more force than was necessary, and here also we cannot use golden scales.\\r\\nHe was entitled to cause death and he did not kill more than one man.\\r\\nHe fired only two shots and, as the learned High Court Judges observe, he obviously aimed low.\\r\\nThe High Court holds the mob had moved up to his locality When he fired the shots, so the looting and the beating 572 on the doors were not the isolated acts of a few scattered individuals.\\r\\nIt was the mob that was doing it and in the High Court \\'s words, \"The very fact that in the town of Katni two shots should have struck four Sindhis and none else shows that the rival community was on the move in that area.\\r\\n\" In our opinion, the appellant did not use more force than was necessary.\\r\\nIndeed, the firing, far from acting as a deterrent, spurred them on and they ransacked and looted the place.\\r\\nWe have confined our attention to the right of private defence of the person though in this case the question about the defence of property happens to be bound up with it.\\r\\nThe appeal is allowed.\\r\\nThe convictions and sentences are set aside and the appellant will be released.\\r\\n', {'entities': [[9, 31, 'CASE_NUMBER'], [95, 115, 'DATE'], [152, 158, 'GPE'], [160, 179, 'JUDGE'], [184, 200, 'JUDGE'], [214, 236, 'CASE_NUMBER'], [272, 288, 'DATE'], [297, 320, 'COURT'], [322, 330, 'GPE'], [344, 365, 'CASE_NUMBER'], [371, 381, 'PETITIONER'], [386, 397, 'PETITIONER'], [399, 413, 'LAWYER'], [419, 434, 'LAWYER'], [467, 478, 'RESPONDENT'], [500, 509, 'DATE'], [554, 561, 'JUDGE'], [713, 718, 'GPE'], [726, 744, 'DATE'], [894, 923, 'OTHERS'], [925, 932, 'OTHERS'], [1936, 1946, 'OTHERS'], [3411, 3421, 'PROVISION'], [4388, 4400, 'PROVISION'], [4449, 4462, 'PROVISION'], [4467, 4470, 'PROVISION'], [4759, 4770, 'PROVISION'], [5529, 5534, 'GPE'], [8280, 8285, 'GPE']]}]\n",

Chibber (amicus curia ), for the appellant, B. Sen, for the respondent.\\r\\n439 1952.\\r\\nFebruary 27.\\r\\nThe following Judgments were delivered.\\r\\nPATANJALI SASTRI C.J.\\r\\nThis appeal raises questions under article 14 of the Constitution more or less similar to those dealt with by this Court in Criminal Appeal No. 297 of 1951, The State of West Bengal vs Anwar Ali Sarkar(1), and it was heard in part along with that appeal but was adjourned to enable the respondent State to file an affidavit explaining the circumstances which led to the enactment of the Saurashtra State Public Safety Measures (Third Amendment) Ordinance, 1949 (No. XLVI of 1949), hereinafter referred to as the impugned Ordinance.\\r\\nAs in the West Bengal case, the jurisdiction of the Special Court of Criminal Jurisdiction, which tried and convicted the appellant, was challenged on the ground that the impugned Ordinance, under which the Court was constitut ed, was discriminatory and void.\\r\\nThe Objection was overruled by the Special Judge as well as by the High Court of Sau rashtra on appeal and the appellant now seeks a decision of this Court on the point.\\r\\nThe impugned Ordinance purports to amend the Saurashtra State Public Safety Measures Ordinance (No. IX of 1948) which had been passed \"to provide for public safety, mainte nance of public order and preservation of peace and tran quillity in the State of Saurashtra\", by the insertion of sections 7 to 18 which deal with the establishment of Spe cial Courts of criminal jurisdiction in certain areas to try certain classes of offences in accordance with a simplified and shortened procedure.\\r\\nSection 9 empowers the State by notification to constitute Special Courts for such \\'areas as may be specified in the notification and section 10 provides for appointment of Special Judges to preside over such courts.\\r\\nSection 11 enacts that the Special Judge shall try \"such offences or classes of offences or such cases or classes of cases as the Government may, by general or special order in writing; direct\", (1) Since reported as ; 57 57 440 Then follow provisions prescribing the procedure applicable to the trial of such offences.\\r\\nThe only variations in such procedure from the normal procedure in criminal trials in the State consist of the abolition of trial by jury or with the aid of assessors and the elimination of the inquiry before commitment in sessions cases.\\r\\nEven under the normal procedure trial by jury is not compulsory unless the Govern ment so directs (sections 268 and 269 (1)).\\r\\nwhile assessors are not really members of the court and their opinion is not binding on the judge with whom the responsibility for the decision rests.\\r\\nNor can the commitment proceeding in a sessions case be said to be an essential requirement of a fair and impartial, trial, though its dispensation may involve the deprivation of certain advantages which an accused person may otherwise enjoy.\\r\\nThus the variations from the normal procedure are by no means calculated to imperil the chances of a fair and impartial trial.\\r\\nIn exercise of the power conferred by sections 9, 10 and 11, the Government issued the notification No. H/35 5 C dated 9/11 February, 1950, directing that a Special Court shall be constituted for certain special areas and that it shall try certain specified offences which included offences under sections 302, 307 and 392 read with section 34 of the Indian Penal Code (as adapted and applied to the State of Saurashtra) for which the appellant was convicted and sen tenced.\\r\\nIt is contended on behalf of the appellant that section 11 and the notification referred to above are discriminatory in that the offences alleged to have been committed by the appellant within the specified areas are required to be tried by the Special Judge under the special procedure, while any person committing the same offences outside those areas would be tried by the ordinary courts under the ordi nary procedure.\\r\\nIt is also urged that sections 9 and 11 by empowering the State Government to establish a Special Court and to direct it to try under a special procedure such offences as may be notified by the Government, in effect, authorise the Government to 441 amend section 5 of the Criminal Procedure Code read with the Second Schedule (as adapted and applied to the State of Saurashtra), which provides that \"all offences under the Indian Penal Code shall be investigated, enquired into, tried and otherwise dealt with according to the provisions hereinafter contained\", and that delegation of such power to the executive Government was beyond the competence of a legislature and was, therefore, void.\\r\\nOn the first point, many of the considerations which weighed with me in upholding the constitutionality of sec tion 5 (1) of the West Bengal Special Courts Act, which is in identical terms with section 11 of the impugned Act, apply a fortiori to the present case.\\r\\nThe West Bengal case (1) arose out of a reference by the State Government of certain individual cases to the Special Court for trial and 1 there expressed the view that it was wrong to think that classification was something that must somehow be discovera ble in every piece of legislation or it would not be legis lation.\\r\\nThat way of regarding classification, I pointed out, tended only to obscure the real nature of the problems for which we have to find solution.\\r\\nIn the present case, howev er, the State Government referred not certain individual cases but offences of certain kinds committed in certain areas and so the objection as to discriminatory treatment is more easily answered on the line of reasoning indicated in my judgment in the West Bengal case (1).\\r\\nAgain, the varia tions from the normal procedure authorised by the impugned Ordinance are less disadvantageous to the persons tried before the Special Court than under the West Bengal Act.\\r\\nIt was, however, said that any variation in procedure which operates materially to the disadvantage of such persons was discriminatory and violative of article 14.\\r\\nOn the other hand, it was contended on behalf of the respondent State that, in the field of personal liberty, the only constitu tional safeguards were those specifically.\\r\\nprovided in articles 20 to 22, and \\'this Court having held in (1) [1952] S.C.R.284.\\r\\n442 Gopalan \\'s case (1) that any procedure prescribed by law satisfies the requirements of article 21 (the only article relevant here) the impugned Ordinance which prescribes a special procedure for trial of offences falling within its ambit could not be held to be unconstitutional.\\r\\nReliance was placed on a decision of a Full Bench of the Hyderabad High Court (Abdur Rahim and others vs Joseph A. \\'Pinto and others (2) which seems to lend some support to this view.\\r\\nI am, however, of opinion that neither of these extreme con tentions is sound.\\r\\nAll legislative differentiation is not necessarily dis criminatory.\\r\\nIn fact, the word \"discrimination\" does not occur in article 14.\\r\\nThe expression \"discriminate against\" is used in article 15 (1) and article.\\r\\n16(2), and it means, according to the Oxford Dictionary, \"to make an adverse distinction with regard to; to distinguish unfavourably from others\".\\r\\nDiscrimination thus involves an element of unfa vourable bias and it is in that sense that the expression has to be understood in this context.\\r\\nIf such bias is disclosed and is based on any of the grounds mentioned in articles 15 and 16, it may well be that the statute will, without more, incur condemnation as violating a specific constitutional prohibition unless it is saved by one or other of the provisos to those articles.\\r\\nBut the position under article 14 is different.\\r\\nEqual protection claims under that article are examined with the presumption that the State action is reasonable and justified.\\r\\nThis pre sumption of constitutionality stems from the wide power of classification which the legislature must, of necessity, possess in making laws operating differently as regards different groups of persons in order to give effect to its policies.\\r\\nThe power of the State to regulate criminal trials by constituting different courts with different procedures according to the needs of different parts of its territory is an essential part of its police power (cf.\\r\\nMissouri vs Lewis)(3).\\r\\nThough the differing (1) ; (3) 101 U.S.22 (2) A.I.R. 1951 Hyderabad ll. 443 procedures might involve disparity in the treatment of the persons tried under them, such disparity is not by itself sufficient, in my opinion, to outweigh the presumption and establish discrimination unless the degree of disparity goes beyond what the reason for its existence demands as, for instance, when it amounts to a denial of a fair and impar tial trial.\\r\\nIt is, therefore, not correct to say that arti cle 14 provides no further constitutional protection to personal liberty than what is afforded by article 21.\\r\\nNotwithstanding that its wide general language is greatly qualified in its practical application by a due recognition of the State \\'s necessarily wide powers of legislative clas sification, article 14 remains an important bulwark against discriminatory procedural laws.\\r\\nIn the present case, the affidavit filed on behalf of the respondent State by one of its responsible officers states facts and figures relating to an increasing number of incidents of looting, robbery, dacoity, nosecutting and murder by marauding gangs of dacoits in certain areas of the State, and these details support the claim that \"the securi ty of the State and public peace were jeopardised and that it became impossible to deal with the offences that were committed in different places in separate courts of law expeditiously.\\r\\n\" The statement concludes by pointing out that the areas specified in the notification were the \"main zones of the activities of the dacoits as mentioned above.\\r\\n\" The impugned Ordinance having thus been passed to combat the increasing tempo of certain types of regional crime, the two fold classification on the lines of type and territory adopted in the impugned Ordinance, read with the notifi cation issued thereunder, is, in my view, reasonable and valid, and the degree of disparity of treatment involved is in no way in excess of what the situation demanded.\\r\\nOn the second point, the appellant \\'s learned counsel claimed that the majority view in In re The , etc.(1) supported his contention.\\r\\nHe attempted to make this out by piecing together certain dicta (1) ; 444 found in the several judgments delivered in that case.\\r\\nWhile undoubtedly certain definite conclusions were reached by the majority of the Judges who took part in the decision in regard to the constitutionality of certain specified enact ments, the reasoning in each case was different and it is difficult to say that any particular principle has been laid down by the majority which can be of assistance in the determination of other cases.\\r\\nI have there expressed my view that legislatures in this country have plenary authori ty to delegate their power to make laws to subordinate agencies of their choice and such delegation, however inex pedient or undesirable politically, is constitutionally competent.\\r\\nI accordingly reject this contention.\\r\\nIt follows that the Special Judge had jurisdiction to try the appellant and the persons accused along with him.\\r\\nAs the majority concur in overruling the preliminary objection the appeal will be heard on the merits.\\r\\nFAZL ALI J.\\r\\nThis is an appeal by one Kathi Raning Rawat, who has been convicted under sections 302, 307 and 392.\\r\\nread with section 34 of the Indian Penal Code and sentenced to death and to seven years \\' rigorous imprison ment.\\r\\nThe appellant was tried by a Special Court constitut ed under the Saurashtra State Public Safety Measures(Third Amendment) Ordinance, 1949 (Ordinance No. LXVI of 1949), which was issued by the Rajpramukh of Saurashtra on the 2nd November, 1949, and his conviction and sentence were upheld on appeal by the State High Court.\\r\\nHe has preferred an appeal to this Court against the decision of the High Court.\\r\\nThe principal question which arises in this appeal is whether the Ordinance to which reference has been made is void under article 13(1) of the Constitution on the ground that it violates the provisions of article 14.\\r\\nIt appears that on the 5th April, 1948, the Rajpramukh of Saurashtra State promulgated an Ordinance called the Criminal Proce dure Code, 1898 (Adaptation) Ordinance, 1948 (Ordinance No. XII of 445 1948), by which \"the Criminal Procedure Code of the Dominion of India as in force in that Dominion on the 1st day of April, 1948\" was made applicable to the State of Saurashtra with certain modifications.\\r\\nIn the same month, another Ordinance called the Saurashtra State Public Safety Measures Ordinance (Ordinance No. IX of 1948) was promulgated, which provided among other things for the detention of persons acting in a manner prejudicial to public safety, maintenance of public order and peace and tranquillity in the State.\\r\\nSubsequently, on the 5th November, 1949, the Ordinance with which we are concerned, namely, the Saurashtra State Public Safety Measures (Third Amendment) Ordinance, 1949, was promulgated, which purported to amend the previous Ordinance by inserting in it certain provisions which may be summa rised as follows : Section 9 of the Ordinance empowers the State Government by notification in the Official Gazette to constitute Spe cial Courts of criminal jurisdiction for such area as may be specified in the notification.\\r\\nSection 11 provides that a Special Judge shall try such offences or classes of offences or such cases or classes of cases as the State Government may, by general or special order in writing, direct.\\r\\nSec tions 12 to 18 lay down the procedure for the trial of cases by the Special Judge, the special features of which are as follows : (1) The Special Judge may take cognizance offences without the accused being committed to his court for trial; (2) There is to be no trial by jury or with the aid of assessors; (3) The Special Judge should \\'ordinarily record a memo randum only of the substance of the evidence of each wit ness; and (4) The person convicted has to appeal to the High Court within 15 days from the date of the sentence.\\r\\n446 The Ordinance further provides that the provisions of sections 491 and 526 of the Code of Criminal Procedure shall not apply to any person or case triable by the Special Judge, and the High Court may call for the record of the proceedings of any case tried by a Special Judge and may exercise any of the powers conferred on an appellate court by sections 423, 426, 427 and 428 of the Code.\\r\\nFrom the foregoing summary of the provisions of the Ordinance, it will appear that the difference between the procedure laid down in the Criminal Procedure Code and the procedure to be followed by the Special Judge consists mainly in the following matters: (1) Where a case is triable by a court of session, no commitment proceeding is necessary, and the Special Judge may take cognizance without any commitment; (2) The trial shall not be by jury or with the aid of assessors; (3) Only a memorandum of the substance of the evidence of.\\r\\neach witness is ordinarily to be recorded; (4) The period of limitation for appeal to the High Court is curtailed; and (5) No court has jurisdiction to transfer any case from any Special Judge, or to make an order under section 491 of the Criminal Procedure Code.\\r\\nIt appears that pursuant to the provisions contained in sections 9, 10 and 11 of the Ordinance, the State Government issued a Notification No. H/35 5 C, dated the 9/11th Febru ary, 1951, directing the constitution of a Special Court for certain areas mentioned in a schedule attached to the Noti fication and empowering such court to try the following offences, namely, offences under sections 183, 189, 190, 212, 216, 224, 302, 304, 307, 323 335, 341 344, 379 382, 384 389 and 392 402 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860, as adapted and applied to the State of Saurashtra, and most of t, be offences under the.\\r\\nOrdinance of 1948.\\r\\n447 In the course of the hearing, an affidavit was filed by the Assistant Secretary in the Home Department of the Sau rashtra Government, stating that since the integration of different States in Kathiawar in the beginning of 1948 there had been a series of crimes against public peace and that had led to the promulgation of Ordinance No. IX of 1948, which provided among other things for detention of persons acting in a manner prejudicial to public safety and mainte nance of public order in the State.\\r\\nNotwithstanding this Ordinance, the crimes went on increasing and there occurred numerous cases of dacoity, murder, nosecutting, ear cutting, etc.\\r\\nfor some of which certain notorious gangs were respon sible, and hence Ordinance No. LXVI of 1949 was promulgated to amend the earlier Ordinance and to constitute Special Courts for the speedy trial of cases arising out of the activities of the dacoits and other criminals guilty of violent crimes.\\r\\nAs has been already indicated, the main contention advanced before us on behalf of the appellant is that the Ordinance of 1949 violates the provisions of article 14 of the Constitution, by laying down a procedure which is dif ferent from and less advantageous to the accused than the ordinary procedure laid down in the Criminal Procedure Code, and thereby discriminating between persons who are to be tried under the special procedure and those tried under the normal procedure.\\r\\nIn support of this argument, reliance is placed on the decision of this court in The Slate of West Bengal vs Anwar Ali Sarkar and Gajen Mali (Cases Nos. 297 and 298 of 1951) (1), in which certain provisions of the West Bengal Special Courts Act, 1949, have been held to be unconstitutional on grounds similar to those urged on behalf of the appellant in the present ease.\\r\\nA comparison of the provisions of the Ordinance in question with those of the West Bengal Act will show that several of the objectionable features in the latter enactment do not appear in the Ordi nance, (1) ; 58 448 but, on the whole, I am inclined to think that that circum stance by itself will not afford justification for upholding the Ordinance.\\r\\nThere is however one very important differ ence between the West Bengal Act and the present Ordinance which, in my opinion, does afford such justification, and I shall try to refer to it as briefly as possible.\\r\\nI think that a distinction should be drawn between\"dis crimination without reason\" and \\' \\'discrimination with rea son\".\\r\\nThe whole doctrine of classification is based on this distinction and on the well known fact that the circum stances which govern one set of persons or objects may not necessarily be the same as those governing another set of persons or objects, so that the question of unequal treat ment does not really arise as between persons governed by different conditions and different sets of circum stances.\\r\\nThe main objection to the West Bengal Act was that it permitted discrimination \"without reason\" or with out any rational basis.\\r\\nHaving laid down a procedure which was materially different from and less advantageous to the accused than the ordinary procedure, that Act gave uncon trolled and unguided authority to the State Government to put that procedure into operation in the trial of any case or class of cases or any offence or class of offences.\\r\\nThere was no principle to be found in that Act to control the application of the discriminatory provisions or to correlate those provisions to some tangible and rational objective, in such a way as to enable anyone reading the Act to say : If that is the objective, the provisions as to special treatment of the offences seem to be quite suitable and there can be no objection to dealing with a particular type of offences on a special footing.\\r\\nThe mere mention of speedier trial as the object of the Act did not cure the defect, because the expression \"speedier trial\" standing by itself provided no rational basis of classification.\\r\\nIt was merely a description of the result sought to be achieved by the application of the special procedure laid down in the Act \\' and afforded no help in determining what cases required speedier trial.\\r\\n449 As regards the present Ordinance, we can discover a guiding principle within its four corners, which cannot but have the effect of limiting the application of the special procedure to a particular category of offences only and establish such a nexus (which was missing in the West Bengal Act) between offences of a particular category and the object with which the Ordinance was promulgated, as should suffice to repel the charge of discrimination and furnish some justification for the special treatment of those of fences.\\r\\nThe Ordinance, as I have already stated, purported to amend another Ordinance, the object of which was to provide for public safety, maintenance of public order and preservation of peace and tranquillity in the State.\\r\\nIt was not disputed before us that the preamble of the original Ordinance would govern the amending Ordinance also, and the object of promulgating the subsequent Ordinance was the same as the object of promulgating the original Ordinance.\\r\\nOnce this is appreciated, It is easy to see that there is something in the Ordinance itself to guide the State Govern ment to apply the special procedure not to any and every case but only to those cases or offences which have a ra tional relation to, or connection with, the main object and purpose of the Ordinance and which for that reason become a class by themselves requiring to be dealt with on a special footing.\\r\\nThe clear recital of a definite objective furnishes a tangible and rational basis of classification to the State Government for the purpose of applying the provi sions of the Ordinance and for choosing only such offences or cases as affect public safety, maintenance of public order and preservation of peace and tranquillity.\\r\\nThus, under section 11, the State Government is expected to select only such offences or class of offences or class of cases for being tried by the special court in accordance with the special procedure, as are calculated to affect public safety, maintenance of public order, etc., and under section 9, the use of the special procedure must necessarily be confined to only disturbed areas or those areas where adoption of 450 public safety measures is necessary.\\r\\nThat this is how the Ordinance was intended to be understood and was in fact understood, is confirmed by the Notification issued on the 9/11th February by the State Government in pursuance of the Ordinance.\\r\\nThat Notification sets out 49 offences under the Indian Penal Code as adapted and applied to the State and certain other offences punishable under the Ordinance, and one can see at once that all these offences directly affect the maintenance of public order and peace and tran quillity.\\r\\nThe Notification also specifies certain areas in the State over which only the special court is to exercise jurisdiction.\\r\\nThere can be no dispute that if the State Legislature finds that lawlessness and crime are rampant and there is a direct threat to peace and tranquil lity in certain areas within the State, it is competent to deal with offences which affect the maintenance of public order and preservation of peace and tranquillity in those areas as a class by themselves and to provide that such offences shall be tried as expeditiously as possible in accordance with a special procedure devised for the purpose.\\r\\nThis, in my opinion, is in plain language the rationale of the Ordinance, and it will be going too far to say that in no case and under no circumstances can a legislature lay down a special procedure for the trial of a particular class of offences, and that recourse to a simplified and less cumbrous procedure for the trial of those offences, even when abnormal conditions prevail, will amount to a violation of article 14 of the Constitution.\\r\\nI am satisfied that this case is distinguishable from the case relating to the West Bengal Act, but I also feel that the legislatures should have recourse to legislation such as the present only in very special circumstances.\\r\\nThe question of referring individual cases to the special court does not arise in this appeal, and I do not wish to express any opinion on it.\\r\\nCertain other points were urged on behalf of the appel lant, namely, that the Ordinance suffers from excessive delegation of legislative authority, and that 451 the Rajpramukh had exceeded his powers in amending the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code.\\r\\nThese contentions were found to be devoid of all force and have to be reject ed.\\r\\nIn the result, I would hold that the Saurashtra State Public Safety Measures (Third Amendment) Ordinance is not unconstitutional, and accordingly overrule the objection as to the jurisdiction of the special court to try the appel lant.\\r\\nMAHAJAN J.\\r\\nThe principal point for decision in the appeal is whether section 11 of the Saurashtra State Public Safety Measures (Third Amendment) Ordinance (No. LXVI), 1949.\\r\\nwhich came into force on 2nd November, 1949, is hit by article 14 of the Constitution inasmuch as it mentions no basis for the differential treatment prescribed in the Ordinance for trial of criminals in certain cases and for certain offences.\\r\\nSection 11 of the Ordinance is in these terms : \"A Special Judge shall try such offences or classes of offences or such cases or classes of cases as the Government of the United State of Saurashtra may, by general or special order in writing, direct.\\r\\n\" This section is in identical terms with section 5(1) of the West Bengal Special Courts Act (Act X of 1950).\\r\\nSection 5(1) of that Act provided as follows : \"A Special Court shall try such offences or classes of offences or cases or classes of cases, as the State Govern ment may, by general or special order in writing, direct.\\r\\n\" The question whether section 5(1) of the Bengal Act (X of 1950) was hit by article 14 of the Constitution was an swered in the affirmative by this court in The State of West Bengal vs Anwar Ali Sarkar etc.(1) In that case I was of the opinion that even if the statute on the face of it was not discriminatory, it was so in its effect and opera tion inasmuch as it vested in the executive government unregulated official discretion and therefore had to be adjudged unconstitutional.\\r\\nSection 11 of the Ordinance, like section 5(1) (1) ; 452 of the West Bengal Act, suggests no reasonable basis or classification either in respect of offences or in respect of cases.\\r\\nIt has laid down no measure for the grouping either of persons or of cases or of offences by which meas ure these groups could be distinguished from those outside the purview of the special Act.\\r\\nThe State Government can choose a case of a person similarly situate and hand it over to the special tribunal and leave the case of another person in the same circumstances to be tried by the procedure laid down in the Criminal Procedure Code.\\r\\nIt can direct that the offence of simple hurt be tried by the special tribunal while a more serious offence be tried in the ordinary way.\\r\\nThe notification in this case fully illustrates the point.\\r\\nOffence of simple hurt punishable with two years \\' rigorous imprisonment is included in the list of offences to be tried by the Special Judge, while a more serious offence of the same kind punishable with heavier punishment under section 308 is excluded from the list.\\r\\nIt is the mischief of section 11 of the Ordinance that makes such discrimination possible.\\r\\nTo my mind, offences falling in the group of sections 302 to 308, Indian Penal Code.\\r\\npossess common characteristics and the appellant can reasonably complain of hostile dis crimination.\\r\\nI am therefore of the opinion that section 11 of the Ordinance is unconstitutional and the conviction of the appellant under the Ordinance by the special judge is bad and must be quashed.\\r\\nThere will be a retrial of the appellant under the procedure prescribed by the Code of Criminal Procedure.\\r\\nThe contention of the learned counsel for the State that the provisions of the Ordinance are in some respects distinguishable from the provisions of the West Bengal Special Courts Act cannot be sustained.\\r\\nReference was made to section 9 of the Ordinance which is in these terms : \"The Government of the United State of Saurashtra may by notification in the official gazette constitute Special Courts of criminal jurisdiction for such area as may be specified in the notification.\\r\\n\" 453 This section is in the same terms as section 3 of the West Bengal Special Courts Act.\\r\\nIt only empowers the State Government to constitute Special Courts for any area or for the whole of the State of Saurashtra in the like manner in which section 3 empowered the West Bengal Government to constitute special courts for the whole of the State or any particular area, It does not in any way limit or curtail the power conferred on the State Government by the provi sions of section 11.\\r\\nReference was also made to the pream ble of the original Ordinance which uses the familiar con ventional phraseology: \"An Ordinance to provide for public safety, maintenance of public order and preservation of peace and tranquillity in the State of Saurashtra.\\r\\n\" These words cannot limit the plain and unambiguous language of section 11 of the Ordinance which authorises the State Government to send any case or commit persons guilty of any offence to the special judge for trial by the procedure prescribed in the Ordinance.\\r\\nMUKHERJEA J.\\r\\nThe appellant before us was tried,along with two other persons, by the Special Judge, Court of Criminal Jurisdiction, Saurashtra State, on charges of murder, at tempted murder and robbery under sections 302, 307 and 392 of the Indian Penal Code read with section 34.\\r\\nBy his judgment dated 20th December, 1950, the Special Judge con victed the appellant on all the three charges and sentenced him to death under section 302 and to seven years \\' rigorous imprisonment both under sections 307 and 392 of the Indian Penal Code.\\r\\nThe conviction and sentences were upheld by the High Court of Saurashtra on appeal.\\r\\nThe appellant has now come to this court on the strength of a certificate granted by the High Court under articles 132(1) and 134(1)(c) of the Constitution.\\r\\nThe appeal has not been heard on its merits as yet.\\r\\nIt was set down for hearing on certain preliminary points of law raised by the learned counsel for the appellant attacking the legality of the entire trial on the ground that section 11 of the Saurashtra Public 454 Safety Measures Ordinance No. XLVI of 1949 passed by the Rajpramukh of Saurashtra as well as the Notification issued by the State Government on 9/11th February, 1951, under which the Special Court was constituted and the trial held, were void and inoperative.\\r\\nThe first and the main ground upon which the constitutional validity of the section and the notification has been assailed is that they are in conflict with the provision of article 14 of the Constitu tion.\\r\\nThe other point raised is that the provision of section 11 the Ordinance is illegal as it amounts to delegation of essential legislative powers by the State Legislature to the Executive.\\r\\nSo far as the first point is concerned, the learned counsel for the appellant has placed great reliance upon the majority decision of this court in two analogous appeals from the Calcutta High Court (being cases Nos. 297 and 298 of 1951)(1), where a similar question arose in regard to the validity of section 5 (1) of the West Bengal Special Courts Act, 1950.\\r\\nIn fact, it was because of our pronouncement in the Calcutta appeals that it was considered desirable to have the present case heard on the preliminary points of law.\\r\\nIt is not disputed that the language of section 11 of the Saurashtra Ordinance, with which we are now concerned, is identically the same as that of section 5 (1) of the West Bengal Special Courts Act.\\r\\nThe wording of the section is as follows: \"11.\\r\\nJurisdiction of Special Judges A Special Judge shall try such offences or classes of offences or such cases or classes of cases as the Government of the United State of Saurashtra may, by general or special order in writing, direct.\\r\\n\" In the West Bengal Act there is a further provision em bodied in clause (2) of section 5 which lays down that no such direction as is contemplated by clause (1) could be given in respect of cases pending before ordinary criminal courts at the date when the Act came into force.\\r\\nNo such exception has been made in the Saurashtra Ordinance.\\r\\nIn the Calcutta cases referred (1) Since reported as ; 455 to above, the notification under section 5(1) of the West Bengal Act directed certain individual cases in which speci fied persons were involved to be tried by the Special Court and it was held by the High Court of Calcutta that section 5 (1) of the West Bengal Special Courts Act to the extent that it empowers the State Government to direct any case to be tried by Special Courts was void as offending against the provision of the equal protection clause in article 14 of the Constitution; and this view was affirmed in appeal by a majority of this court, With regard to the remaining part of section 5(1), which authorises the State Government to direct, \"offences, classes of offences. or classes of cases\" for trial by Special Courts, the majority of the Judges of the Calcutta High Court were of opinion that it was not obnoxious to article 14 of the Constitution.\\r\\nIn the present case the notification, that was issued by the Sau rashtra State Government on 9/11th February, 1951, did not relate to individual cases.\\r\\nThe notification constituted in the first place a Special Court in the areas specified in the schedule.\\r\\nIt appointed in the next place a judge to preside over the Special Court and finally gave a list of offences with reference to appropriate sections of the Indian Penal Code which were to be tried by the Special Judge.\\r\\nIf the view taken by the Chief Justice of the Cal cutta High Court and the majority of his colleagues is right, such notification and that part of section 11 of the Ordinance, under which it was issued, could not be chal lenged as being in conflict with article 14 of the Constitu tion.\\r\\nThis point did come up for consideration before us in the appeals against the Calcutta decision with reference to the corresponding part of section 5 (1) of the West Bengal Act, but although a majority of this court concurred in dismissing the appeals, there was no such majority in the pronouncement of any final opinion on this particular point.\\r\\nIn my judgment in the Calcutta appeals I was sceptical about the correctness of the view taken upon this point by the learned Chief Justice of the Calcutta High Court and the majority of his colleagues.\\r\\nThe 59 456 consideration that weighed with me was that as the learned Judges were definitely of opinion that the necessity of speedier trial.\\r\\n, as set out in the preamble, was too elusive and uncertain a criterion to form the basis of a proper classification, the authority given by section 5 (1) of the Special Courts Act to the State Government to direct any class of cases or offences \\' to be tried by the Special Court would be an unguided authority and the propriety of the classification made by the State Government that is said to be implied in the direction could not be tested with refer ence to any definite legislative policy or standard.\\r\\nMr. Sen appearing for the State of Saurashtra, has argued be: fore us that in this respect the Saurashtra Ordinance stands on a different footing and he has referred in this connec tion to the preamble to the original ordinance as well as the circumstances which necessitated the present one.\\r\\nAs the question is an important one and is not concluded by our previous decision, it merits, in my opinion, a careful consideration.\\r\\nIt may be stated at the outset that the Criminal Procedure Code of India as such has no application to the State of Saurashtra.\\r\\nAfter the State acceded to the Indian Union, there was an Ordinance promulgated by the Rajpramukh on 5th of April, 1948, which introduced the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code of India (Act V of 1898) with certain modifications into the Saurashtra State.\\r\\nAnother ordinance, known as the Public Safety Measures Ordinance, was passed on the 2nd of April, 1948, and this ordinance, like similar other public safety measures obtaining in other States, provided for preventive detention, imposition of collective fines, control of essential supplies and similar other matters.\\r\\nOn 11th of November, 1949, the present ordinance was passed by way of amendment of the Public Safety Measures Ordinance and inter alia it made provisions for the establishment of special courts.\\r\\nSection 9 of this Ordinance empowers the State Government to constitute spe cial courts of criminal.jurisdiction for such areas as may be specified in the notification.\\r\\nSection 10 relates to appointment.\\r\\n457 of Special Judges who are to preside over such courts and section 11 lays down that the Special Judge shall try \"such offences or classes of offences. . or classes of cases as the Government of United State of Saurashtra may, by general or special order in writing, direct.\\r\\n\" The proce dure to be followed by the Special Judges is set out in sections 12 to 18 of the Ordinance.\\r\\nIn substance the Spe cial Court is given the status of a sessions court, although committal proceeding is eliminated and so also is trial by jury or with the aid of assessors.\\r\\nThe Special Judge has only to make a memorandum of the evidence and he can refuse to summon any witness if he is satisfied after examination of the accused that the evidence of such witness would not be material.\\r\\nSection 16 (1) curtails the period of limita tion within which an accused convicted by the Special Judge has to file his appeal before the High Court and clause (3) of the section provides that no court shall have jurisdic tion to transfer any case from any Special Judge or make any order under section 491 of the Criminal Procedure Code.\\r\\nThe ordinance certainly lacks some of the most objectionable features of the West Bengal Act.\\r\\nThus it has not taken away the High Court \\'s power of revision, nor does it expose the accused to the chance of being convicted of a major offence though he stood charged with a minor one.\\r\\nThere is also no provision in the ordinance similar to that in the West Bengal Act which enables the court to proceed with the trial in the absence of the accused.\\r\\nBut although the ordinance in certain respects compares favourably with the West Bengal Act, the procedure which it lays down for the Special Judge to follow does differ on material points from the normal procedure prescribed in the Criminal Procedure Code; and as these differences abridge the rights of the accused who are to be tried by the Special Court, and deprive them of cer tain benefits to which they would otherwise have been enti tled under the general law, the ordinance prima facie makes discrimination and the question has got to be answered whether such discrimination brings it in conflict with article 14 of the Constitution.\\r\\n458 The nature and scope of the guarantee that is implied in the equal protection clause of our Constitution have been explained and discussed in more than one decision of this court and do not require repetition.\\r\\nIt is well settled that a legislature for the purpose of dealing with the complex problems that arise out of an infinite variety of human relations, cannot but proceed upon some sort of selection or classification of persons upon whom the legislation is to operate.\\r\\nThe consequence of such classification would un doubtedly be to differentiate the persons belonging to that class from others, but that by itself would not make the legislation obnoxious to the equal protection clause.\\r\\nEqual ity prescribed by the Constitution would not be violated if the statute operates equally on all persons who are included in the group, and the classification is not arbitrary or capricious, but bears a reasonable relation to the objective which the legislation has in view.\\r\\nThe legislature is given the utmost latitude in making the classification and it is only when there is a palpable abuse of power and the differ ences made have no rational relation to the objectives of the legislation, that necessity of judicial interference arises.\\r\\nSection 11 of the Saurashtra Ordinance so far as it is material for our present purpose lays down that a Special Court shall try such offences or classes of offences. or classes of cases as the State Government may. direct\".\\r\\nThis part of the section undoubtedly contemplates a classi fication to be made of offences and cases but no classifica tion appears on the terms of the statute itself which merely gives an authority to the State Government to determine what classes of cases or offences are to be tried by the special tribunal.\\r\\nThe question arises at the outset as to whether such statute is not on the face of it discriminatory as it commits to the discretion of an administrative body or officials the duty of making selection or classification for purposes of the legislation; and there is a still further question, namely, by what tests, if any, is the propriety of the administrative action to be adjudged and what would be the remedy of the aggrieved person if the 459 classification made by the administrative body is arbitrary or capricious ? It is a doctrine of the American courts which seems to me to be well founded on principle that the equal protection clause can be invoked not merely where discrimination ap pears on the express terms of the statute itself, but also when it is the result of improper or prejudiced execution of the law (1).\\r\\nBut a statute will not necessarily be condem ned as discriminatory, because it does not make the classi fication itself but, as an effective way of carrying out its policy, vests the authority to do it in certain officers or administrative bodies.\\r\\nIllustrations of one class of such cases are to be found in various regulations in the U.S.A. which are passed by States in exercise of police powers for the purposes of protecting public health or welfare or to regulate trades, business and occupations which may become unsafe or dangerous when unrestrained.\\r\\nThus there are regu lations where discretion is lodged by law in public officers or boards to grant or withhold licence to keep taverns or sell spirituous liquors(2), or other commodities like milk(3) or cigarettes(4).\\r\\nSimilarly, there are regulations relating to appointment of river pilots(5) and other trained men necessary for particularly difficult jobs and in such cases, ordinarily, conditions are laid down by the statute, on compliance with which a candidate is consid ered qualified.\\r\\nBut even then the appointment board has got a discretion to exercise and the fact of the candidate for a particular post is submitted to the judgment of the officer or the board as the case may be.\\r\\nIt is true that these cases are of a somewhat different nature than the one we are dealing with; but it seems to me that the principle underly ing all these cases is the same.\\r\\nThe whole problem is one of choosing the method by which the legislative policy is to be effectuated.\\r\\nAs has been observed by Frankfurter J. in (1) Vide Weaver on Constitutional Law, p. 404.\\r\\n(2)Crowley vs Uhristensen; , (3) People of the State of New York vs Job.\\r\\nE, Van De Carr, 199 U.S.552.\\r\\n(4) Gundling vs Chicago, ; (5) Kotch vs Board of River Port Pilot Commissioners, 330 U.S.552.\\r\\n460 Tinger vs Texas(1), \"laws are not abstract propositions. but are expressions of policy arising out of specific difficulties addressed to the attainment of specif ic ends by the use of specific remedies.\\r\\n\" In my opinion, if the legislative policy is clear and definite and as an effective method of carrying out that policy a discretion is vested by the statute upon a body of administrators or officers to make selective application of the law to certain classes or groups of persons, the statute itself cannot be condemned as a piece of discriminatory legislation.\\r\\nAfter all \"the law does all that is needed when it does all that it can, indicates a policy. and seeks to bring within the lines all similarly situated so far as its means allow(2) \\' \\'.\\r\\nIn such eases, the power given to the executive body would import a duty on it to classify the subject matter of legislation in accordance with the objective indicated in the statute.\\r\\nThe discretion that is conferred on official agencies in such circumstances is not an un guided discretion; it has to be exercised in conformity with the policy to effectuate which the direction is given and it is in relation to that objective that the propriety of the classification would have to be tested.\\r\\nIf the administra tive body proceeds to classify persons or things on a basis which has no rational relation to the objective of the legislature, its action can certainly be annulled as offend ing against the equal protection clause.\\r\\nOn the other hand, if the statute itself does not disclose a definite policy or objective and it confers authority on another to make selec tion at its pleasure, the statute would be held on the face of it to be discriminatory irrespective of the way in which it is applied.\\r\\nThis, it seems to me, is the true principle underlying the decision of the Supreme Court of America in Yick Wo vs Hopkins(3).\\r\\nThe object of the ordinance of the City and County of San Francisco, which came up for consid eration in that case, was, as found by the court, not to regulate laundry business in that locality in the interests of the general public(4).\\r\\nThe business was (1) ; at 147.\\r\\n(2) Vide Buck vs Belt, ; , 208.\\r\\n(3) (4) Vide the observations of Field J. in Crowley vs Chris tensen; , ,94.\\r\\n461 harmless in itself and useful to the community.\\r\\nNo policy was indicated or object declared by the legislature, but an uncontrolled discretion was given to the Board of Supervi sors who could refuse license at their pleasure to anybody carrying on laundry business in wooden buildings.\\r\\nThe classification contemplated by the statute was an arbitrary classification depending on the caprice of the Board, and consequently it was condemned as discriminatory on the face of it;its application against the Chinese was a confirmation of the discriminatory character and the really hostile intention of the legislation.\\r\\nI would be inclined to think that the West Bengal case, which we have decided already, comes within the purview of this principle, as the desira bility of \"speedier trial\", which is hinted at in the pream ble to the West Bengal Act, is too vague, elusive and uncer tain a thing to amount to an enunciation of a definite policy or objective on the basis of which any proper classi fication could be made.\\r\\nthe matter has been left to the unfettered discretion of the State Government which can classify offences or cases in any way they like without regard to any objective and as such the statute is open to the challenge of making arbitrary discrimination.\\r\\nThe point that requires consideration is, whether the Saurashtra Ordinance presents any distinguishing features or occupies the same position as the West Bengal Act ? As has been stated already, section 11 of the Saurash tra Ordinance is worded in exactly the same manner as sec tion 5(1) of the West Bengal Special Courts Act; and that part of it, with which we are here concerned, authorises the State Government to direct any classes of offences or cases to be tried by the special tribunal.\\r\\nThe State Government, therefore, has got to make a classification of cases or offences before it issues its directions to the Special Court.\\r\\nThe question is, on what basis is the classification to be made ? If it depends entirely upon the pleasure of the State Government to make any classification it likes, with out any guiding principle at all.\\r\\nit cannot certainly be a proper classification, Which requires that a reasonable relation must exist 462 between the classification and the objective that the legis lation has in view.\\r\\nOn the other hand, if the legislature indicates a definite objective and the discretion has been vested in the State Government as a means of achieving that object, the law itself, as I have said above, cannot be held to be discriminatory, though the action of the State Govern ment may be condemned if it offends against the equal pro tection clause, by making an arbitrary selection.\\r\\nNow, the earlier ordinance, to which the present one is a subsequent addition by way of amendment, was passed by the Rajpramukh of Saurashtra on 2nd April, 1948.\\r\\nIt is described as an ordinance to provide for the security of the State, mainte nance of public order and maintenance of supplies and serv ices essential to the community in the State of Saurashtra.\\r\\nThe preamble to the ordinance sets out the objective of the ordinance in identical terms.\\r\\nIt is to be noted that the integration of several States in Kathiawar which now form the State of Saurashtra, was completed some time in Febru ary, 1948.\\r\\nIt appears from the affidavit of an officer of the Home Government of the Saurashtra State that soon after the integration took place, an alarming state of lawlessness prevailed in some of the districts within the State.\\r\\nThere were gangs of dacoits operating at different places and their number began to increase gradually.\\r\\nAs ordinary law was deemed insufficient to cope with the nefarious activi ties of those criminal gangs, the Saurashtra Public Safety Measures Ordinance was promulgated by the Rajpramukh on 2nd April, 1948.\\r\\nThe ordinance, as stated already, provided principally for preventive detention and imposition of collective fines \\'; and it was hoped that armed with these extraordinary powers the State Government would be able to bring the situation under control.\\r\\nThese hopes, however, were belied, and the affidavit gives a long list of offences in which murder and nose cutting figure conspicuously in addition to looting and dacoity, which were committed by the dacoits during the years 1948 and 1949.\\r\\nIn view of this ugly situation in the Star, the new Ordinance was 463 passed on 11th of November, 1949, and this ordinance pro vides inter alia for the establishment of Special Courts which are to try offenders under a special procedure.\\r\\nActing under section 11 of the Ordinance, the Government issued a notification on 9/11th February, 1950, which Con stituted a Special Court for areas specified in the sched ule.\\r\\nand here again the affidavit shows that all these areas are included in the districts of Gohilwad, Madhya Saurashtra and Sorath, where the tribe of marauders principally flour ished.\\r\\nThe object of passing this new ordinance is identi cally the same for which the earlier ordinance was passed, and the preamble to the latter, taken along with the sur rounding circumstances.\\r\\ndiscloses a definite legislative policy which has been sought to be effectuated by the dif ferent provisions contained in the enactment.\\r\\nIf Special Courts were considered necessary to cope with an abnormal situation.\\r\\nit cannot be said that the vesting of authority in the State Government to select offences for trial by such courts is in any way unreasonable.\\r\\nIn the light of the principles stated already, I am unable to hold that section 11 of the Ordinance in so far as it authorises the State Government to direct classes of offences or cases to be tried by the Special Court offends against the provision of the equal protection clause in our Constitution.\\r\\nIf the notification that has been issued by the State Government proceeds on any arbitrary or unreasona ble basis, obviously that could be challenged as unconstitu tional.\\r\\nIt is necessary, therefore, to examine the terms of the notification and the list of offences it has prescribed.\\r\\nThe notification, as said above, constitutes a Special Court for the areas mentioned in the Schedule and appoints Mr. P.P. Anand as a Special Judge to preside over the Spe cial Court.\\r\\nThe offences triable by the Special Court are then set out with reference to the specific sections of the Indian Penal Code.\\r\\nMr. Chibber attacks the classification of offences made in this list primarily on the ground that while it mentions offences of a particular character, it excludes at the same time other offences of a cognate char acter in reference to 60 464 which no difference in treatment is justifiable.\\r\\nIt is pointed out that while section 183 of the Indian Penal Code is mentioned in the list, sections 184, 186 and 188 which deal with similar offences are excluded.\\r\\nSimilarly the list does not mention section 308, Indian Penal Code, though it mentions section 307.\\r\\nThe learned counsel relies in this connection upon the decision of the Supreme Court of America in Skinner vs Oklahoma(1).\\r\\nIn that case the question for consideration related to the constitutionality of a certain statute of Oklahoma which provided for sterilization of certain habitual criminals who were convicted two or more times in any State of felony involving moral turpitude.\\r\\nThe statute applied to persons guilty of larceny, which was a felony, but not to embezzlement, and it was held that the legislation violated the equal protection clause.\\r\\nIt is undoubtedly a sound and reasonable proposition that when the nature of two offences is intrinsically the same and they are punishable in the same manner, a person accused of one should not be treated differently from a person accused of the other, because it is an essential principle underlying the equal protection clause that all persons similarly circumstanced shall be treated alike both in privileges conferred and liabilities imposed.\\r\\nAt the same time it is to be noted as Douglas J. observed in the very case that in determining the reach and scope of particular legislation it is not necessary for the legislature to provide abstract symmetry.\\r\\n\"It may mark and set apart the classes and types of problems according to the needs and as dictated or sug gested by experience.\\r\\n\" A too rigid insistance therefore on a thing like scientific classification is neither practica ble nor desirable.\\r\\nIt is true that the notification men tions section 183 of the Indian Penal Code, though it omits section 184; but I am unable to hold that the two are iden tically of the same nature.\\r\\nSection 183 deals with resist ance to the taking of property by the lawful authority of public servant; while section 184 relates to obstructing sale of property offered for sale (1) ; 465 by authority of public servant.\\r\\nSection 186 on the other hand does not relate to the taking of property at all, but is concerned with obstructing a public servant in the dis charge of his public duties.\\r\\nThen again I am not sure that it was incumbent upon the State Government to include section 308, Indian Penal Code, in the list simply because they included section 307.\\r\\nIt is true that culpable homicide as well as attempt to murder are specified in the list; but an attempt to commit culpable homicide is certain ly a less heinous offence and the State Government might think it proper, having regard to all the facts known to them, that an offence of attempt to commit culpable homicide does not require a special treatment.\\r\\nBe that as it may, I do not think that a meticulous examination of the various offences specified in the list with regard to their nature and punishment is necessary for purposes of this case.\\r\\nThe appellant before us was accused of murder punishable under section 302 of the Indian Penal Code.\\r\\nThere is no other offence, I believe, described in the Indian Penal Code, which can be placed on an identical footing as murder.\\r\\nEven culpable homicide not amounting to murder is something less heinous than murder, although it finds a place in the list.\\r\\nIn my opinion, the appellant can have no right to complain if he has not been aggrieved in any way by any unjust or arbitrary classification.\\r\\nAs he is accused of murder and dacoity and no offences of a similar nature are excluded from the list, I do not think that it is open to him to complain of any violation of equal protection clause in the notification.\\r\\nThere are quite a number of offences specified in the notification and they are capable of being grouped under various heads.\\r\\nSimply because cer tain offences which could have been mentioned along with similar others in a particular group have been omitted therefrom, it cannot be said that the whole list is bad.\\r\\nThe question of inequality on the ground of such omission can be raised only by the person who is directed to be tried under the special 466 procedure for a certain offence, whereas for commission of a similar offence not mentioned in the list another person has still the advantages of the ordinary procedure open to him.\\r\\nIn my opinion, therefore, the first point raised on behalf of the appellant cannot succeed.\\r\\nThe other point urged by the learned counsel for the appellant which relates to the question of delegation of legislative authority by the Rajpramukh to the State Govern ment admits, I think, of a short answer.\\r\\nIt is conceded by the learned counsel that the facts of this case are identi cal with those of King Emperor vs Benoarilal Sarma (1) which was decided by the Privy Council.\\r\\nIn fact, the language of section 5 of the Special Criminal Courts Ordinance (No. II of 1942) which came up for consideration in that case is almost the same as that of section 11 of the Saurashtra Ordinance.\\r\\nIt was held by the Privy Council that it was not a ease of delegated legislation at all, but merely an exam ple of the not uncommon legislative arrangement by which the local application of the provision of a statute is deter mined by the judgment of a local administrative body as to its necessity.\\r\\nIn other words, it was a case of conditional legislation coming within the rule of Queen vs Burah (2).\\r\\nThe pronouncement of the Judicial Committee in Benoarilal \\'s case (2) has been accepted and acted upon by this court in more than one case and it is too late now to question its correctness.\\r\\nMy conclusion, therefore, is that both the preliminary points must be disallowed and the appeal should be heard on its merits.\\r\\nDAS J.\\r\\nThe appellant before us was tried by a Special Court constituted under the Saurashtra Public Safety Meas ures (Third Amendment) Ordinance No. LXVI of 1949 for of fences alleged to have been committed by him under sections 302, 307 and 392 of the Indian Penal Code.\\r\\nOn December 20, 1950, he was found guilty of the offences charged against him and was convicted and sentenced to death under section 302, (1) 72 I.A. 57.\\r\\n(2) 3 App.\\r\\n889. 467 Indian Penal Code, and to seven years rigorous imprisonment under each of the charges under sections 307 and 392, Indian Penal Code, the sentences of imprisonment running concur rently He appealed to the High Court of Saurashtra but the High Court, by its judgment pronounced on February 28, 1951, rejected his appeal and confirmed his conviction and the sentences passed by the Special Court.\\r\\nBy its order made on March 21, 1951, however, the High Court granted him a cer tificate for appeal to this Court both under article 132 and article 134 (1) (c) of the Constitution.\\r\\nThis appeal has accordingly been filed in this Court.\\r\\nA preliminary point has been raised by learned counsel for the appellant, namely, that the Special Court had no jurisdiction to try this case and the whole trial and con viction have been illegal and void ab initio and should be quashed in limine.\\r\\nIt is necessary, for the disposal of the preliminary objection, to refer to the provisions of the Ordinance and the circumstances in which the Special Court came to be constituted.\\r\\nIn the beginning of 1948 the different States in Kathia war were integrated into what is now the State of Saurash tra.\\r\\nAbout that time different dacoits indulged in lawless activities in Kathiawar and in particular in the area now known as the districts of Gohilwad and Madhya Saurashtra and on the outskirts of Sorath that was formerly a district in Junagadh State.\\r\\nTheir activities gathered such strength and virulence that the security of the State and the maintenance of public peace became seriously endangered.\\r\\nIn order to check their nefarious activities the Rajpramukh of the State of Saurashtra on April 2, 1948, promulgated Ordinance No. IX of 1948.\\r\\nThe preamble of the Ordinance recited that \\'it was \"expedient to provide for public safety, maintenance of public order and preservation of peace and tranquillity in the State of Saurashtra.\\r\\n\" that Ordinance gave power to the State Government to make orders, amongst other things, for detaining or restricting the movements or 468 actions of persons and impose collective fines.\\r\\nThe Rajpra mukh on April 5, 1948, promulgated another Ordinance No. XII of 1948 which extended to the State of Saurashtra the provi sions of the Code of Criminal Procedure (Act V of 1898) subject to certain adaptations and modifications mentioned in the Schedule thereto.\\r\\nIt appears from the affidavit of Ramnikrai Bhagwandas Vesavada, Assistant Secretary in the Home Department, Government of Saurashtra, that the Ordi nance was not sufficient to cope with the activities of the gangs of dacoits and that cases of looting, dacoity, rob bery, nose cutting and murder continued as before and indeed increased in number, frequency and vehemence and it became impossible to deal with the offences at different places in separate Courts of law expeditiously.\\r\\nIn view of the seri ous situation prevailing in those districts the State of Saurashtra considered it necessary to constitute Special Courts and to provide for a special procedure of trials so as to expedite the disposal of cases in which offences of certain specified kinds had been committed.\\r\\nThe Rajpramukh of Saurashtra accordingly, on November 2, 1949, promulgat ed Ordinance No. LXVI of 1949 called \"The Saurashtra State Public Safety Measures (Third Amendment) Ordinance, 1949\", whereby it amended the Saurashtra State Public Safety Meas ures Ordinance (No. IX of 1948).\\r\\nBy section 4 of the Ordi nance No. LXVI of 1949 several sections were added to Ordi nance No. IX of 1948.\\r\\nThree of the sections thus added, which are material for our present purposes, were sections 9, 10 and 11 which run as follows : \"9.\\r\\nSpecial Courts.\\r\\nThe Government of the United State of the Saurashtra may by notification in the Official Ga zette constitute Special Courts of Criminal Jurisdiction for such area as may be specified in the notification.\\r\\nSpecial Judges.\\r\\nThe Government of the United State of Saurashtra may appoint a Special Judge to preside over a Special Court constituted under section 9 for any area any person who has been 469 a Sessions Judge for a period of not less than 2 years under the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898, as applied to the United State of Saurashtra.\\r\\nJurisdiction of Special Judges.\\r\\nA Special Judge shall try such offences or classes of offences or such cases or classes of cases as the Government of the United State of Saurashtra may, by general or special order in writing, direct.\\r\\n\" Pursuant to the provisions of the Ordinance as amended the State of Saurashtra issued a notification, the material part of which is as follows : \"No. H/35 5 C In exercise of the powers conferred by sections 9, 10 and 11 of the Saurashtra State Public Safety Measures Ordinance, 1948, (Ordinance No. IX of 1948), here inafter referred to as the said Ordinance), Government is pleased to direct (i) that a Special Court of a Criminal Jurisdiction, (hereinafter referred to as the said Court) shall be consti tuted for the areas, mentioned in the schedule hereto an nexed, and that the headquarters of the said Court shall be at Rajkot, (ii) that Mr. P.P. Anand shall be appointed as a Spe cial Judge to preside over the said Court and (iii) that the Special Judge hereby appointed shall try the following offences, viz. . (a) offences under sections 183, 189, 190, 212, 216 224, 302, 304.\\r\\n307,323 to 335, 341 to 344, 379 to 382 384 to 389 and 392 to 402 of the Indian Penal Code 1860 (XLV of 1860), as adapted and applied to the United State of Saurashtra, and (b) all offences under the said Ordinance, except an offence punishable under sub section (6) of section 2 of the said Ordinance, in so far as it relates to the contravention of an order made under clause (a) of subsection (1) of the said section.\\r\\n\" The appellant having been charged with offences included in the Notification he was tried by the Special Court with the result I have mentioned.\\r\\nThe preliminary objection raised on his behalf is that section 470 11 of the Ordinance is invalid in that (a) it offends against article 14 of our Constitution, and (b) it autho rises illegal delegation of legislative power to the State Government.\\r\\nIn support of the first ground on which the preliminary objection is rounded reliance is placed by learned coun sel for the appellant on the judgment of this Court in Case No. 297 of 1951 (The State of West Bengal vs Anwar Ali Sarkar).\\r\\nThat case was concerned with the validity of the trial of the respondent therein by a Special Court consti tuted under the provisions of the West Bengal Special Courts Act, 1950 (West Bengal Act X of 1950).\\r\\nThe preamble to that Act recited that it was \"expedient to provide for the speedier trial of certain offences\".\\r\\nSections 3, 4 and 5 (1) of the West Bengal Special Courts Act, 1950, reproduced substantially, if not verbatim, the provisions of sections 9, 10 and 11 of the Saurashtra Ordinance of 1948 as subse quently amended.\\r\\nThe notification issued by the State of West Bengal under that Act was, however, different from the notification issued by the State of Saurashtra in that the West Bengal notification directed certain specific \"cases\" to be tried by the Special Court constituted under the West Bengal Special Courts Act.\\r\\nThat notification had obviously been issued under that part of section 5 (1) of the West Bengal Special Courts Act which authorised the State Govern ment to direct particular \"cases\" to be tried by the Special Court.\\r\\nA majority of this court held that at any rate section 5 (1) of the West Bengal Special Courts Act in so far as it authorised the State to direct \"cases\" to be tried by the Special Court and the notification issued thereunder offended against the provisions of article 14 of the Consti tution and as such were void under article 13.\\r\\nThe Saurash tra notification, however, has been issued quite obviously under that part of section 11 which authorises the State Government to direct \"offences \\' \\', \"classes of offences\" or \"classes of cases\" to be tried by the Special Court and the question before us on the present appeal is whether that part of section 11 under 471 which the present notification has been issued offends against the equal protection clause of our Constitution.\\r\\nIt is contended that the opinion expressed by the majority of this Court in \\' the West Bengal case on the corresponding part of section S (1) of the West Bengal Special Courts Act was not necessary for the purposes of that appeal and re quires reconsideration.\\r\\nAfter referring to our previous decisions in Chiranjit Lal Choudhury vs The Union of India and Others (1) and The State of Bombay vs\\r\\nF.N. Balsara (2), I summarised the meaning, scope and effect of article 14 of our Constitu tion, as I understand it, in my judgment in the West Bengal case which I need not repeat but to which I fully adhere.\\r\\nIt is now well established that while article 14 forbids class legislation it does not forbid reasonable classification for the purposes of legislation.\\r\\nIn order, however, to pass the test of permissible classification, two conditions must be fulfilled, namely, (i) that the classifi cation must be rounded on an intelligible differentia which distinguishes persons or things that are grouped together from others left out of the group, and (ii)that that differ entia must have a rational relation to the object sought to be achieved by the Act.\\r\\nWhat is necessary is that there must be a nexus between the basis of classification and the object of the Act.\\r\\nIt will be noticed that section 11 of the Saurashtra Ordinance, like section 5 (1) of the West Bengal Special Courts Act, refers to four distinct categories, namely, \"offences\", \"classes of offences\", \"cases\" and \"classes of cases\" and empowers the State Government to direct any one or more of these categories to be tried by the Special Court constituted under the Act.\\r\\nThe expressions \"offences\", \"classes of offences\" and \"classes of cases\" clearly indi cate and obviously imply a process of classification of offences or cases.\\r\\n(1) ; (2) ; at p. 326 ; ; 61 472 Prima facie those words do not contemplate any particular offender or any particular accused in any particular case.\\r\\nThe emphasis is on \"offences\", \"classes of offences\" or \"classes of cases.\\r\\n\" The classification of \"offences\" by itself is not calculated to touch any individual as such, although it may, after the classification is made, affect all individuals who may commit the particular offence.\\r\\nIn short, the classification implied in this part of the sub section has no reference to, and is not directed towards, the singling out of any particular person as an object of hostile State action but is concerned only with the grouping of \"offences\", \"classes of offences\" and \"classes of cases\" for the purposes of the particular legislation as recited in its preamble.\\r\\nAn argument was raised, as in the West Bengal ease, that even this part of the section gave an uncontrolled and unguided power of classification which might well be exer cised by the State Government capriciously or \"with an evil eye and an unequal hand\" so as to deliberately bring about invidious discrimination between man and man although both of them were situated in exactly the same or similar circumstances.\\r\\nI do not accept this argument as sound, for, the reasons I adopted in my judgment in the West Bengal case in repelling this argument apply with equal, if not with greater, force to the argument directed against the validity of the Saurashtra Ordinance.\\r\\nIt is obvious that this part of section 11 of the Ordinance which, like the corresponding part of section 5 (1) of the West Bengal Special Courts Act, confers a power on the State Government to make a classifi cation of \"offences\", \"classes of offences\" or \"classes of cases\", makes it the duty of the State government to make a proper classification, that is to say, a classification which must fulfil both conditions, namely, that it must be based on some intelligible differentia distinguishing the offences grouped together from other offences and that that differentia must have a reasonable relation to the object of the Act as recited in the preamble.\\r\\nA 473 classification on a basis which does not distinguish one offence from another offence or which has no relation to the object of the Act will be wholly arbitrary and may well be hit by the principles laid down by the Supreme Court of the United States in Jack Skinner vs Oklahoma(1).\\r\\nOn the other hand, as I observed in the West Bengal case, it is easy to visualise a situation when certain offences, by reason of the frequency of their perpetration or other attending circumstances, may legitimately call for a special treatment in order to check the commission of such offences.\\r\\nAre we not familiar with gruesome crimes of murder, arson, loot and rape committed on a large scale during communal riots in particular localities and are they not really different from a case of a stray murder, arson, loot or rape in another district which may not be affected by any communal upheaval ? Does not the existence of the gangs of dacoits and the concomitant crimes committed on a large scale as mentioned in the affidavit filed on behalf of the State call for prompt and speedier trial for the maintenance of public order and the preservation of peace and tranquillity in the State and indeed of the very safety of the community ? Do not those special circumstances add a peculiar quality to the offences or classes of offences specified in the notifi cation so as to distinguish them from stray cases of similar crimes and is it not reasonable and even necessary to the State with power to classify them into a separate group and deal with them promptly ? I have no doubt to \\' my mind that the surrounding circumstances and the special features mentioned in the affidavit referred to above furnish a very cogent and reasonable basis of classification, for they do clearly distinguish these offences from similar or even same species of offences committed elsewhere and under ordinary circumstanceS.\\r\\nThis differentia quite clearly has a reason able relation to the object sought to be achieved by the Act, namely, the maintenance of public order, the preserva tion of public safety, the peace and tranquillity of the State.\\r\\nSuch a classification (1) 216 U.S. 535; L. Ed. 1655.\\r\\n474 will not be repugnant to the equal protection clause of our Constitution, for there will be no discrimination, for whoever may commit the specified offence in the specified area in the specified circumstances will be treated alike and sent up before a Special.\\r\\nCourt for trial under the special procedure.\\r\\nPersons thus sent up for trial by a Special Court cording to the special procedure cannot point their fingers to the other persons who may be charged before an ordinary Court with similar offences alleged to have been committed by them in a different place and in different circumstances and complain of unequal treatment, for those other persons are of a different category and are not their equals.\\r\\nIn my judgment, this part of the section, properly construed and understood, does not confer an uncontrolled and unguided power on the State Government.\\r\\nOn the con trary, this power is controlled by the necessity for making a proper classification which is to be guided by the pream ble in the sense that the classification must have a ration al relation to the object of the Act as recited in the preamble.\\r\\nIt is, therefore, not an arbitrary power.\\r\\nThe Legislature has left it to the State Government to classify offences or classes of offences or classes of cases for the purpose of the Ordinance, for the State Government is in a better position to judge the needs and exigencies of the State and the Court will not lightly interfere with the decision of the State Government.\\r\\nIf at any time, however, the State Government classifies offences arbitrarily and not on any reasonable basis having a relation to the object of the Act, its action will be either an abuse of its power if it is purposeful, or in excess of its powers even if it is done in good faith, and in either case the resulting discrimination will encounter the challenge of the Constitu tion and the Court will strike down, not the law which is good, but the abuse or misuse or the unconstitutional admin istration of the law creating or resulting in unconstitu tional discrimination.\\r\\nIn this case, however, the facts stated in the affidavit filed on behalf of the State make it abundantly 475 clear that the situation in certain parts of the State was sufficient to add a particularly sinister quality to certain specified offences committed within those parts and the State Government legitimately grouped them together in the notification.\\r\\nThe criticism that the State Government in cluded certain offences but excluded certain cognate of fences has been dealt with by my learned brother Mukherjea and I have nothing more to add thereto.\\r\\nIn my opinion, lot reasons given in my judgment in the West Bengal case and referred to above, section 11 of the Saurashtra Ordinance in so far as it authorises the State Government to direct offences or classes of offences or classes of cases to be tried by the Special Court does not offend against the equal protection clause of our Constitu tion and the notification which has been issued under that part of the section cannot be held to be invalid or ultra vires.\\r\\nOn the question of delegation of legislative power the matter appears to be concluded by the decision of the Privy Council in Benoarilal \\'s case(1) and the section may well be regarded as an instance of conditional legislation.\\r\\nFur ther, I would be prepared to say, for reasons stated in my judgment in the President \\'s Reference(2) that there has been no illegal delegation of legislative power.\\r\\nFor reasons stated above, I agree that the preliminary point should be rejected and the appeal should be heard on its merits.\\r\\nCHANDRASEKHARA AIYAR J. Mr.\\r\\nSen tried his best to distinguish this case from our decision on the West Bengal Special Courts Act, 1950, The State of West Bengal vs Anwari Ali Sarkar and Gajan Mali (3).\\r\\nBut in my view he has not succeeded in his attempt.\\r\\nSections 9 and 11 of the Ordinance in question do not lay down any classification in themselves.\\r\\nThe preamble to the earlier Ordinance of 1948, which is still intact as the later one is only an amending (1) L.R. 72 I.A. 57.\\r\\n(3) Cases Nos. 297 & 298 of 1951.\\r\\nSince (2) ; reported as ; 476 measure, merely refers to the need to provide for public safety, maintenance of public order, and the preservation of peace and tranquillity in the State of Saurashtra.\\r\\nThis by itself indicates no classification, as the object is a general one, which has to be kept in view by every enlight ened government or system of administration.\\r\\nEvery law dealing with the commission and the punishment of offences is based on this need.\\r\\nThe notification under which the Special Court was established no doubt deals with \"offences\" as distinguished from \"cases\" or \"groups of cases,\" but here also, there is no rational classification.\\r\\nOffences present ing the same characteristic features, and cognate in this sense, have been separately dealt with; some of them are to go before the Special Court, while others are left to be tried by the ordinary courts.\\r\\nThe circumstance that the deviations from normal procedure prescribed in the Ordinance are not so many or vital, as in the Bengal case, does not in nay humble opinion, affect the result, as the defect of the absence of a reasonable or rational classification is still there.\\r\\nThe negation of committal proceedings is a matter of much moment to the accused, as it deprives him of the un doubted advantage of knowing the evidence for the prosecu tion and discrediting it by cross examination, leading possibly to his discharge even at that early stage.\\r\\nThe argument for the respondent that there has been no discrimination as against the appellant visa vis other persons charged with the same offences is unacceptable.\\r\\nCognate offences have been left over for trial by the ordi nary courts.\\r\\nIt is no answer to the charge by A of discrim inatory legislation to say that B & C have also been placed in the same category as himself, when he finds that D, E & F also liable for the same or kindred offences have been left untouched and are to be tried by ordinary courts under the normal procedure.\\r\\nMuch importance cannot be attached to the affidavit of the Assistant Secretary to the Government.\\r\\nIt may be that all the facts stated by him as regards the frequency and locale of the particular 477 offences are true.\\r\\nBut no such grounds for the classifica tion are indicated, much less stated, either in the impugned Ordinance or notification.\\r\\nThis is certainly not a legal requirement; but a wise prudence suggests the need for such incorporation, as otherwise the ascertainment of the reasons for the classification from extraneous sources may involve the consideration of what may be regarded as after thoughts by way of explanation or justification.\\r\\nIn my. view, the West Bengal Special Courts Act deci sion governs this case also, and section 11 is bad.\\r\\nIt is unnecessary to deal with the other point raised by the learned counsel for the appellants as regards the dele gation of legislative powers involved in the pro tanto repeal of some of the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code, viz., sections 5 and 28 and the Schedule, especially as it seems concluded against him by the decision in King Emperor vs Benoari Lal Sarma and Others(1).\\r\\nThe convictions of the appellant and the sentences imposed on him are set aside, and there will be a retrial under the ordinary procedure.\\r\\nBoss J. I agree with my brothers Mahajan and Chandra sekhara Aiyar that the Saurashtra State Public Safety Meas ures (Third Amendment) Ordinance, offends article 14.\\r\\nAs I explained in my judgment in The State of West Bengal vs Artwar Ali Sarkar(2), I prefer not to base my decision on the classification test.\\r\\nFor the reasons given there I am of opinion that the differentiation here travels beyond.\\r\\nbounds which are legitimate.\\r\\nIt is true the points of differentiation are not as numerous here as in the other case but the ones which remain are, in my judgment, of a substantial character and cut deep enough to attract the equality clauses in article 14.\\r\\nI would hold the Ordinance invalid.\\r\\nPreliminary objection overruled.\\r\\n(1) (1945) 72 I.A. 57.\\r\\n',

Aggarwala, for the accused.\\r\\nG.S. Mathur, for the State of Rajasthan.\\r\\nDecember 20.\\r\\nBOSE J. delivered judgment as fol lows.\\r\\nFAZL ALI J. agreed.\\r\\nBOSE J.\\r\\nThe appellant Rameshwar was charged with com mitting rape on a young girl Mst.\\r\\nPurni, eight years of age.\\r\\nHe was committed to Sessions and was convicted by the As sistant Sessions Judge, Sawai Jaipur, and sentenced to one year \\'s rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 250.\\r\\nAn appeal was made to the Sessions Judge at Jaipur, that being the appropriate appellate tribunal in that area.\\r\\nThe learned Sessions Judge held that the evidence was sufficient for moral conviction but fell short of legal proof because, in his opinion, the law requires corroboration of the story of the prosecution in such cases as a matter of precaution and the corroborative evidence, in so far as it sought to connect the appellant with the crime, was legally insuffi cient though morally enough.\\r\\nHe was satisfied however that the girl had been raped by somebody.\\r\\nAccordingly, he acquit ted the accused giving him the benefit of the doubt.\\r\\nThe State of Sawal Jaipur and Gangapur appealed against the acquittal to the High Court at Jaipur.\\r\\n380 The learned High Court Judges held that the law requires corroboration in such cases but held that the girl \\'s state ment made to her mother was legally admissible as corrobora tion and considering that sufficient they set aside the acquittal and restored the conviction and sentence.\\r\\nThe High Court later granted leave to appeal under article 134 (1)(c) of the Constitution as the case involved questions of law of general importance.\\r\\nThe first point taken before us related to the admissi bility of the evidence of the girl herself.\\r\\nHer age was stated to be seven or eight years at the time of the exami nation by the learned Assistant Sessions Judge who recorded her testimony.\\r\\nHe certified that she did not understand the sanctity of an oath and accordingly did not administer one to her.\\r\\nHe did not certify that the child understood the duty of speaking the truth.\\r\\nThe proviso to section 5 of the , prescribes that \"Provided that where the witness is a child under twelve years of age, and the Court or person having authority to examine such witness is of opinion that, though he understands the duty of speaking the truth, he does not understand the nature of an oath or affirmation, the forego ing provisions of this section and the provisions of section 6 shall not apply to such witness, but in any such case the absence of an oath or affirmation shall not render inadmis sible any evidence given by such witness nor affect the obligation of the witness to state the truth.\\r\\n\" The question is whether the opinion referred to must be formally recorded or whether it can be inferred from the circumstances in which the deposition was taken.\\r\\nThe proviso quoted above must be read along with section 118 of the Evidence Act and section 13 of the Oaths Act.\\r\\nIn my opinion, an omission to administer an oath, even to an adult, goes only to the credibility of the witness and not his competency.\\r\\nThe question of competency is dealt with in section 118.\\r\\nEvery 381 witness is competent unless the Court considers he is pre vented from understanding the questions put to him, or from giving rational answers by reason of tender years, extreme old age, disease whether of body or mind, or any other cause of the same kind.\\r\\nIt will be observed that there is always competency in fact unless the court considers otherwise.\\r\\nNo other ground of incompetency is given, therefore, unless the Oaths Act adds additional grounds of incompetency it is evident that section 118 must prevail.\\r\\nNow the Oaths Act does not deal with competency.\\r\\nIts main object is to render persons who give false evidence liable to prosecution.\\r\\nIt is true a subsidiary object is to bring home to the witness the solemnity of the occasion and to impress upon him the duty of speaking the truth, but in view of section 118 these matters only touch credibility and not admissibility.\\r\\nIn my opinion, section 13 of the Oaths Act places this beyond doubt.\\r\\nIt states \"No omission to take any oath or make any affirmation. . and no irregularity whatever, in the form in which any one of them is administered, shall invali date any proceeding or render inadmissible any evidence whatever. . \" Section 5 is the main provision regarding the adminis tration of oaths.\\r\\nThe proviso only sets out the cases in which the oath is not to be administered.\\r\\nIf, therefore, an omission to take the oath does not affect the admissibility of the evidence, it follows that irregularity of the kind we are considering which arises out of the proviso cannot affect the admissibility either.\\r\\nSection 118 remains and unless the judge considers otherwise the witness is compe tent.\\r\\nI do not think it will be useful to consider English authorities on the point because we are governed here by the terms of the various sections I have referred to.\\r\\nBut a decision of the Judicial Committee of the Privyi Council is in point.\\r\\nTheir Lordships stated in Mohamed Sugal Esa vs The King(1) : (1) A.I.R. 1946 P.C. 3 at 5 382 \"Section 13, Oaths Act, is quite unqualified in its terms and there is nothing to suggest that it is to apply only where the omission to administer the oath occurs per incuriam.\\r\\nIf that had been the intention of the Legislature, it would have been simple to insert words in the section to that effect. .\\r\\nIt may be observed that this question can no longer arise in India because in 1939 the Legislature passed the Oaths (Amendment) Act (Act XXXIX of 1939) which settles the law in accordance with the Bengal and Oudh decisions referred to above.\\r\\n\" The decisions to which their Lordships refer are and Ram Samujh vs Emperor(2).\\r\\nThe decisions there were that the section being unqualified in terms did apply to a case where the Court accepted the evidence of a child to whom the oath was not administered on the ground that the witness did not understand its nature.\\r\\nThe principle of the decisions ap plies here because, as their Lordships observe, the section is unqualified in its terms.\\r\\nI would add however that it is desirable that judges and magistrates should always record their opinion that the child understands the duty of speaking the truth and state why they think that, otherwise the credibility of the wit ness may be seriously affected, so much so, that in some cases it may be necessary to reject the evidence altogether.\\r\\nBut whether the magistrate or judge really was of that opinion can, I think, be gathered from the circumstances when there is no formal certificate.\\r\\nIn the present case, it is plain that the learned Judge had the proviso in mind because he certified that the witness does not understand the nature of an oath and so did not administer one but despite that went on to take her evidence.\\r\\nIt is also an important fact that the accused, who was represented by counsel, did not object.\\r\\nHad he raised the point the Judge would doubtless have made good the omission.\\r\\nI am of opinion that Mst.\\r\\nPurni was a competent witness and that her evi dence is admissible.\\r\\nIn (1) F.N. (2) (1907) 10 O.C. 337 383 the Privy Council case which I have just cited, their Lord ships said \"It is not to be supposed that any judge would accept as a witness a person who he considered was incapable not only of understanding the nature of an oath but also the necessi ty of speaking the truth when examined as a witness.\\r\\n\" That is the very point here.\\r\\nOne can presume that the learned Judge had that in mind from the fact that he exam ined the child after referring to a fact which arises out of the proviso.\\r\\nAs regards her credibility, the learned trial Judge, who recorded her evidence and saw her in the box, has believed her, so has the High Court; and it is important to note that the learned Sessions Judge who acquitted the accused has not disbelieved her.\\r\\nOn the contrary he says he is morally convinced.\\r\\nAll he says is that in the absence of corrobora tion it will be unsafe to convict because the Privy Council and other cases advise corroboration as a matter of pru dence.\\r\\nWe were taken carefully through the evidence, as elabo rately as in a court of first appeal.\\r\\nI am of opinion that the learned High Court Judges were fully justified in ac cepting the evidence of Purni and in believing her mother Mst.\\r\\nGhisi.\\r\\nI consider it unnecessary to recapitulate their reasons.\\r\\nAfter the careful analysis given by three Courts it is sufficient to say that I agree with the learned High Court Judges.\\r\\nWe are left therefore with the questions of law.\\r\\nThe first question is whether the law requires corrobo ration in these cases.\\r\\nNow the Evidence Act now here says so.\\r\\nOn the other hand, when dealing with the testimony of an accomplice, though it says in section 114 (b) that the Court may presume that an accomplice is unworthy of credit unless he is corroborated in material particulars, it makes it clear in section 133 that \"An accomplice shall be a competent witness against an accused person; and a conviction is not 50 384 illegal merely because it proceeds upon the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice.\\r\\n\" Now a woman who has been raped is not an accomplice.\\r\\nIf she was ravished she is the victim of an outrage.\\r\\nIf she consented there is no offence unless she is a married woman, in which case questions of adultery may arise.\\r\\nBut adultery presupposes consent and so is not on the same footing as rape.\\r\\nIn the case of a girl who is below the age of consent, her consent will not matter so far as the offence of rape is concerned, but if she consented her testimony will natural ly be as suspect as that of an accomplice.\\r\\nSo also in the case of unnatural offences.\\r\\nBut in all these cases a large volume of case law has grown up which treats the evidence of the complainant somewhat along the same lines as accomplice evidence though often for widely differing reasons and the position now reached is that the rule about corroboration has hardened into one of law.\\r\\nBut it is important to under stand exactly what the rule is and what the expression \"hardened into a rule of law\" means.\\r\\nIn my judgment, this branch of the law is the same as in England and I am of opinion that the lucid exposition of it given by Lord Reading, the Lord Chief Justice of England, in The King vs Baskerville(1) cannot be bettered.\\r\\nIn that case, Baskerville had been convicted of having committed acts of gross indecency with the two boys.\\r\\n(There the boys were accomplices because they were freely consent ing parties and there was no use of force).\\r\\nThe learned Chief Justice says at page 663 : \"There is no doubt that the uncorroborated evidence of an accomplice is admissible in law.\\r\\nBut it has long been a rule of practice at common law for the judge to warn the jury of the danger of convicting a prisoner on the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice or accomplices, and, in the discretion of the judge, to advise them not to convict upon such evidence; but the judge should point out to the jury that it is (1) 385 within their legal province to convict upon such unconfirmed evidence.\\r\\nThis rule of practice has become virtually equivalent to a rule of law, and since the Court of Criminal Appeal came into operation this Court has held that, in the absence of such a warning by the judge, the conviction must be quashed.\\r\\nIf after the proper caution by the judge the jury nevertheless convict the prisoner, this Court will not quash the conviction merely upon the ground that the accom plice \\'s testimony was uncorroborated.\\r\\n\" That, in my opinion, is exactly the law in India so far as accomplices are concerned and it is certainly not any higher in the case of sexual offences.\\r\\nThe only clarifica tion necessary for purposes of this country is where this class of offence is sometimes tried by a judge without the aid of a jury.\\r\\nIn these cases it is necessary that the judge should give some indication in his judgment that he has had this rule of caution in mind and should proceed to give reasons for considering it unnecessary to require corroboration on the facts of the particular case before him and show why he considers it safe to convict without corrob oration in that particular case.\\r\\nI am of opinion that the learned High Court Judges were wrong in thinking that they could not, as a matter of law, convict without corrobora tion.\\r\\nThere is a class of cases which considers that though corroboration should ordinarily be required in the case of a grown up woman it is unnecessary in the case of a child of tender years.\\r\\nBishram.\\r\\nvs Emperor(1) is typical of that point of view.\\r\\nOn the other hand, the Privy Council has said in Mohamed Sugal Esa vs The King(2) that as a matter of prudence a conviction should not ordinarily be based on the uncorroborated evidence of a child witness.\\r\\nIn my opinion, the true rule is that in every case of this type the rule about the advisability of corroboration should be present to the mind of the judge.\\r\\nIn a jury case he must tell the (1) A.I.R. 1944 Nag. 363.\\r\\n(2) A.I.R. 1946 P.C. 3 at 5.\\r\\n386 jury of it and in a non jury case he must show that it is present to his mind by indicating that in his judgment.\\r\\nBut he should also point out that corroboration can be dispensed with if, in the particular circumstances of the case before him, either the jury, or, when there is no jury, he himself, is satisfied that it is safe to do so.\\r\\nThe rule, which according to the cases has hardened into one of law, is not that corroboration is essential before there can be a con viction but that the necessity of corroboration, as a matter of prudence, except where the circumstances make it safe to dispense with it, must be present to the mind of the judge, and in jury cases, must find place in the charge, before a conviction without corroboration can be sustained.\\r\\nThe tender years of the child, coupled with other circumstances appearing in the case, such, for example, as its demeanour, unlikelihood of tutoring and so forth, may render corrobora tion unnecessary but that is a question of fact in every case.\\r\\nThe only rule of law is that this rule of prudence must be present to the mind of the judge or the jury as the case may be and be understood and appreciated by him or them.\\r\\nThere is no rule of practice that there must, in every case, be corroboration before a conviction can be allowed to stand.\\r\\nI turn next to the nature and extent of the corrobora tion required when it is not considered safe to dispense with it.\\r\\nHere, again, the rules are lucidly expounded by Lord Reading in Baskerville \\'s case(1) at pages 664 to 669.\\r\\nIt would be impossible.\\r\\nindeed it would be dangerous, to formulate the kind of evidence which should, or would, be regarded as corroboration.\\r\\nIts nature and extent must necessarily vary with circumstances of each case and also according to the particular circumstances of the offence charged.\\r\\nBut to this extent the rules are clear.\\r\\nFirst, it is not necessary that there should be inde pendent confirmation of every material circumstance in the sense that the independent evidence in the case, apart from the testimony of the complainant or the (1) , 387 accomplice, should in itself be sufficient to sustain con viction.\\r\\nAs Lord Reading says ``Indeed, if it were required that the accomplice should be confirmed in every detail of the crime, his evidence would not be essential to the case, it would be merely confirmatory of other and independent testimony.\\r\\n\" All that is required is that there must be \"some addi tional evidence rendering it probable that the story of the accomplice (or complainant) is true and that it is reasona bly safe to act upon it.\\r\\n\" Secondly, the independent evidence must not only make it safe to believe that the crime was committed but must in some way reasonably connect or tend to connect the accused with it by confirming in some material particular the testi mony of the accomplice or complainant that the accused committed the crime.\\r\\nThis does not mean that the corrobora tion as to identity must extend to all the circumstances necessary to identify the accused with the offence.\\r\\nAgain, all that is necessary is that there should be independent evidence which will make it reasonably safe to believe the witness \\'s story that the accused was the one, or among those, who committed the offence.\\r\\nThe reason for this part of the rule is that \"a man who has been guilty of a crime himself will always be able to relate the facts of the case, and if the confirmation be only on the truth of that history, without identifying the persons, that is really no corroboration at all.\\r\\nIt would not at all tend to show that the party ac cused participated in it.\\r\\n\" Thirdly, the corroboration must come from independent sources and thus ordinarily the testimony of one accomplice would not be sufficient to corroborate that of another.\\r\\nBut of course the circumstances may be such as to make it safe to dispense with the necessity of corroboration and in those special circumstances a conviction so based would not be illegal.\\r\\nI say this because it was contended that the mother in this case was not an independent source.\\r\\n388 Fourthly, the corroboration need not be direct evidence that the accused committed the crime.\\r\\nIt is sufficient if it is merely circumstantial evidence of his connection with the crime.\\r\\nWere it otherwise, \"many crimes which are usually committed between accomplices in secret, such as incest, offences with females\" (or unnatural offences) \"could never be brought to justice.\" Next, I turn to another aspect of the case.\\r\\nThe learned High Court Judges have used Mst.\\r\\nPurni \\'s statement to her mother as corroboration of her statement.\\r\\nThe ques tion arises, can the previous statement of an accomplice, or a complainant, be accepted as corroboration ? That the evidence is legally admissible as evidence of conduct is indisputable because of Illustration (j) to section 8 of the Evidence Act which is in these terms: \"The question is whether A was ravished.\\r\\nThe facts that, shortly after the alleged rape, she made a complaint relating to the crime, the circumstances under which, and the terms in which, the complaint was made are relevant.\\r\\n\" But that is not the whole problem.\\r\\nfor we are concerned here not only with its legal admissibility and relevancy as to conduct but as to its admissibility for a particular purpose, namely corroboration.\\r\\nThe answer to that is to be found in section 157 of the Evidence Act which lays down the law for India.\\r\\nSection 157 states that \"In order to corroborate the testimony of a witness, any former statement made by such witness relating to the same fact at or about the time when the fact took place, or before any authority legally competent to investigate the fact, may be proved.\\r\\n\" The section makes no exceptions, therefore, provided the condition prescribed, that is to say, \"at or about the time etc. ,\" are fulfilled there can be no doubt that such a statement is legally admissible in India as corroboration.\\r\\nThe weight to be attached to it is, of course, another matter and it may be that in some 389 cases the evidentiary value of two statements emanating from the same tainted source may not be high, but in view of section 118 its legal admissibility as corroboration cannot be questioned.\\r\\nTo state this is, however, no more than to emphasise that there is no rule of thumb in these cases.\\r\\nWhen corroborative evidence is produced it also has to be weighed and in a given case, as with other evidence, even though it is legally admissible for the purpose on hand its weight may be nil.\\r\\nOn the other hand, seeing that corrobo ration is not essential to a conviction, conduct of this kind may be more than enough in itself to justify acceptance of the complainant \\'s story.\\r\\nIt all depends on the facts of the case.\\r\\nIn the present case, Mst.\\r\\nPurni told \\'her mother about the incident about four hours after it occurred.\\r\\nThe reason for the delay was that her mother was not at home when she went there.\\r\\nShe says that when she went home she lay down and went to sleep and that when her mother returned she asked her why she was sleeping and then she told her mother what had happened.\\r\\nHer mother tells much the same story.\\r\\nShe says she had gone out to her field in the morning and did not return till about 4 p.m.\\r\\nWhen she reach home she found her daughter lying there weeping.\\r\\nShe has been be lieved by the learned trial Judge as also by the High Court and has not been disbelieved by the learned Sessions Judge.\\r\\nAll he says is that she is not an \"independent\" witness and is therefore not sufficient for corroboration.\\r\\nThe first question is whether this delay fulfills the \"at or about\" condition.\\r\\nIn my opinion, here also there can be no hard and fast rule.\\r\\nThe main test is whether the statement was made as early as can reasonably be expected in the circumstances of the case and before there was opportu nity for tutoring or concoction.\\r\\nIt was suggested that the child could have complained to some women who were working in the neighbourhood, but that would not be natural in a child.\\r\\nShe would be frightened and her first instinct would be to run home to her mother.\\r\\nThe High Court 390 was satisfied on these points and so am I.\\r\\nConsequently, the matter does fall within the ambit of section 157 read with section 8, Illustration (j).\\r\\nThe next question is whether the mother can be regard ed as an \"independent\" witness.\\r\\nSo far as this case is con cerned, I have no doubt on that score.\\r\\nIt may be that all mothers may not be sufficiently independent to fulfill the requirements of the corroboration rule but there is no legal bar to exclude them from its operation merely on the ground of their relationship.\\r\\nIndependent merely means independent of sources which are likely to be tainted.\\r\\nIn the absence of enmity against the accused there is no reason why she should implicate him falsely.\\r\\nIt is true the ac cused suggested that they were on bad terms but that has not been believed by anyone.\\r\\nThe third question is whether there is independent corroboration connecting the accused with the crime.\\r\\nThe only corroboration relied on for that is the previous state ment of the child to her mother.\\r\\nThat might not always be enough but this rule can be waived in a given case just as much as the necessity for any corroboration at all.\\r\\nIn the present case, the learned High Court Judges would have acted on the uncorroborrated testimony of the girl had they not felt pressed by the corroboration rule.\\r\\nViewing all the circumstances I am satisfied that the High Court was right.\\r\\nI am satisfied that in this case, considering the conduct of the girl and her mother from start to finish, no corrobora tion beyond the statement of the child to her mother was necessary.\\r\\nI am satisfied that the High Court was right in holding that that was enough to make it safe to act on her testimony.\\r\\nI would dismiss the appeal and direct the appellant to surrender to his bail in accordance with the terms of his bond, serve out his sentence and pay the fine.\\r\\nFAZL ALI J.\\r\\nI agree.\\r\\nAppeal dismissed.\\r\\n', {'entities': [[3,

the disputed property as watan property appertaining to the hereditary office of Deshmukhi service.\\r\\nVithalrao was the recipient of a Sanad dated 28th November, 1892, under what was called the Gordon Settlement, the object of which was to commute serv ices of certain watandars in that part of the country and relieve them from liability to perform the services attached to their office on certain terms and conditions which were agreed upon between the Government on the one hand and the watandars on the other.\\r\\nThe terms of the settlement were generally embodied in Sanads and one such Sanad was granted to Vithalrao in 1892.\\r\\nIt is not disputed that after this settlement Vithalrao continued to be watandar as defined by Bombay Act III of 1874, and that the watan in dispute was an impartible estate governed by the rule of 211 primogeniture.\\r\\nIn 1896 Vithalrao died and he was succeeded by his eldest son Ganpatrao under the law of primogeniture.\\r\\nGanpatrao died childless in 1914, leaving behind him his two widows Anandibai and indirabai, of whom the senior widow Anandibais defendant No. 2 in the present suit.\\r\\nBoth the two brothers of Ganpatrao, namely, Nilkanthrao and Anan drao had predeceased him.\\r\\nNilkanthrao left behind him one son named Firangojirao and two daughters, while Anandrao died childless, leaving him surviving his widow Krishnabai, who later on adopted Vithalrao, who is defendant No. 4 in the suit.\\r\\nGanpatrao had left a will bequeathing all his watan and nonwatan properties to Firangojirao and the latter succeeded to the estate both under the will as well as under the law of lineal promogeniture, he being the only male member of the family at that time.\\r\\nFirangojirao died in 1919, leaving Bhimabai, his only daughter, who was a minor at that time.\\r\\nOn 23rd September, 1921, the name of Bhimabai was entered in the village records as watandar in place of Firangojirao and in the year following the Court of Wards, Satara, assumed superintendence of Bhimabai \\'s estate.\\r\\nOn 11th October, 1923, the Government of Bombay by their Reso lution No. A 471 declared the Chikurde Deshmukh watan as lapsed to Government, presumably on the ground that there was no male heir in the watan family after the death of Firangojirao.\\r\\nA new entry was then made in the village register which recorded Bhimabai not as watandar, but as heir of Firangojirao and the lands were described as being converted into ryotvari lands after forfeiture by Govern ment and subjected to full assessment.\\r\\nOn 4th of November, 1924, Krishnabai, the widow of Anandrao, adopted defendant No. 4 as a son to her husband.\\r\\nOn 27th January, 1932, Bhima bai died unmarried and her estate continued under the man agement of the Court of Wards.\\r\\nThe appellants before us, who are the sister \\'s sons of Firangojirao, brought this suit on 5th of August, 1938, and their case, in substance, is that after the Resolution of the Government passed on 11th 212 of October, 1923, the Chikurde estate ceased to be a watan property and the succession to such estate was governed by the ordinary rules of Hindu Law and not by the provisions of Act V of 1886 which postpone relations claiming through a female to a male member of the watan family.\\r\\nIt was urged that the property being the absolute property of Bhimabai and she having died while still a maiden, the plaintiffs, being the nearest heirs of her father, were entitled to succeed under the general rules of Hindu Law.\\r\\nAs said al ready, the defendant No. 4, who is respondent No. 2 in this appeal, was added as a party defendant sometime after the suit was filed and the contention raised on his behalf was that by reason of his having been duly adopted.\\r\\nto Anandrao on 4th of November, 1924, he was the nearest heir to the property in suit which was a watan property and prayed that a declaration in his favour might be made by the court.\\r\\nThe defendant No. 3 claimed to have been adopted as a son to her husband Ganpatrao by Anandibai, the defendant No. 2, some time in February 1939.\\r\\nThe trial court on a consideration of the evidence came to the conclusion that the Chikurde estate was an impartible property governed by the rules of primogeniture.\\r\\nIt was held that, it being an impartible joint estate, the rule of survivorship still applied and consequently on the death of Ganpatrao, without leaving any son, the estate passed by survivorship to the next senior branch which was that of Firangojirao.\\r\\nThe view taken by the Subordinate Judge is that after Firangojirao \\'s death Bhimabai took only a provi sional interest in the property which was liable to be divested by the emergence of a male member by adoption in the family and in fact she was legally divested of her interest in the property when defendant No. 4 was adopted by Anandrao \\'s widow.\\r\\nIn the opinion of the Subordinate Judge the resolution of the Government treating the Chikurde estate as lapsed was premature and could not be made legally so long as there were widows living, who were capable of adopting sonS.\\r\\nThe trial judge held further that even 213 if Bhimabai was taken to have held the property as watan till her death, the next heir to succeed under the Bombay Act V of 1886 would be defendant No. 4 and not the plain tiffs.\\r\\nThe result was that the plaintiffs \\' suit was dismissed.\\r\\nThe plaintiffs then took an appeal to the High Court of Bombay and this appeal was heard by a Division Bench consisting of Macklin in and Rajadhyaksha JJ.\\r\\nThe learned Judges dismissed the appeal and confirmed the deci sion of the trial court, though the reasons given by them are not the same as those given by the trial judge.\\r\\nIt was held by the High Court, on a construction of the Sanad granted to Vithalrao in 1892, that the order of lapse or forfeiture of the watan estate passed by the Government in the year 1923 on the ground of failure of male heirs was not a valid and legal order and although under the relevant clause of the Sanad the Government could, in the absence of male heirs, resume the watan in the sense that they could make the property liable to full assessment, the other incidents of the watan estate still continued.\\r\\nConsequently, Act V of 1886 would still govern succession to such property and defendant No. 4 had preferential rights over the plain tiffs under section 2 of that Act.\\r\\nIt is against this decision that the plaintiffs have come up on appeal to this court.\\r\\nThe learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the plain tiffs appellants has raised a two fold contention in support of the appeal.\\r\\nIt has been contended in the first place that the High Court was in error in holding that the Chikurde estate retained its watan character even after it was re sumed by the Government by its Resolution of 11th October, 1923; and if it was non watan, the plaintiffs would be nearer heirs to Bhimabai than defendant No. 4.\\r\\nThe other contention raised is that even if the property remained watan in the hands of Bhimabai, the latter would have to be regarded as a watandar in the true sense of the word and would be a fresh stock of descent.\\r\\nIn that view the plain tiffs would come within the family of 28 214 watandar as defined in Bombay Act V of 1886, whereas the defendant No. 4 would be outside the family.\\r\\nThe points undoubtedly are interesting, but having regard to the view which we have decided to take, it would not be necessary to investigate the merits of either of them.\\r\\nIt may be pointed out that the learned Judges of the High Court proceeded throughout on the assumption that the plaintiffs would have preferential rights of succession if the property was regarded as non watan in the hands of Bhimabai.\\r\\nIt is only if the property was watan that the Bombay Act of 1886 will apply and the plaintiffs, who were descended through females, would be postponed to defendant No. 4 who by adop tion became a male member of the family.\\r\\nMr. Setalvad, appearing for defendant No. 4 who is respondent No. 2 in this appeal, contended before us that this assumption is wrong, and that even if the property was regarded as nonwa tan property and belonging absolutely to Bhimabai as her stridhan, still as heir of Bhimabai \\'s absolute property the defendant No. 4 would have higher rights than the plain tiffs.\\r\\nAs this point was not touched upon in the judgments of either of the courts below, we heard the learned Counsel on both sides at great length upon it and the conclusion that we have reached is that the contention of the learned AttorneyGeneral is well founded and must prevail.\\r\\nFor the purpose of this argument we would assume that the property in suit was non watan stridhan property of Bhimabai and the only question is, as to who amongst the rival claimants would be the nearer heir after her death according to the Hindu Law of inheritance ? It is admitted that Bhimabai died while she was a maiden and that a maid en \\'s property under the Hindu Law goes in the first place to her uterine brothers, in default of them to the mother and then to the father.\\r\\nThis is according to the text of Baudhayana (1)which is accepted by all the commenta tors.\\r\\nViramitrodaya adds to this that \"on failure of mother and father it goes to their (1) See Mitakshara, Chap.\\r\\nII, sec.\\r\\nXI, para 30.\\r\\n215 nearest relations\"(1).\\r\\nIt has been held in a large number of cases that the expression \"nearest relations of the parents\" means and refers to the sapindas of then, father and in their default the sapindas of the mother both in order of propinquity(2).\\r\\nIn the case c before us, both the plain tiffs and defendant No. 4 are sapindas of Firangojirao, the plaintiffs being the sister \\'s sons of Firangojirao, while the latter is his paternal uncle \\'s son.\\r\\nIt is not dis puted that apart from the changes introduced by the Hindu Law of Inheritance (Amendment) Act, (Act II of 1929), the place of the paternal uncle \\'s son in the line of heirs under the Mitakshara Law of Succession is much higher than that of the sister \\'s son and the Mayukha Law, which prevails in the State of Bombay, does not make any difference in this re spect.\\r\\nUnder the Mitakshara Law, the paternal uncle comes just after the paternal grandfather and his son follows him immediately.\\r\\nBy Act II of 1929, however, four other rela tions have been introduced between the grandfather and the paternal uncle and they are the son \\'s daughter, daughter \\'s daughter, sister and sister \\'s son, and the paternal uncle and his son are thus postponed to these four relations by the Hindu Law of Inheritance Act of 1929.\\r\\nThe question is, whether the provisions of this Act can at all be invoked to determine the heirs of a Hindu female in respect of her stridhan property.\\r\\nThe object of the Act as stated in the preamble is to alter the order in which certain heirs of a Hindu male dying intestate are entitled to succeed to his estate; and section 1 (2) expressly lays down that \"the Act applies only to persons who but for the passing of this Act would have been subject to the Law of Mitakshara in respect of the provisions herein enacted, and it applies to such persons in respect only of the property of males not held in coparcenary and not disposed of by will\".\\r\\nThus the scope of the Act is limited.\\r\\nIt governs succession only to the separate property of a Hindu male who dies intestate.\\r\\nIt does (1) See Viramitrodaya, Chap.\\r\\nV, Part II, Sec. 9.\\r\\n(2) See Mayne \\'s Hindu Law, 11th edition, article 621, page 741.\\r\\n216 not alter the law as regards the devolution of any other kind of property owned by a Hindu male and does not purport to regulate succession to the property of a Hindu female at all.\\r\\nIt is to be noted that the Act does not make these four relations statutory heirs under the Mitakshara Law under all circumstances and for all purposes;it makes them heirs only when the propositus is a male and the property in respect to which it is sought to be applied is his separate property.\\r\\nWhether this distinction between male and female propositus is at all reasonable is another matter, but the language of the Act makes this distinction expressly and so long as the language is clear and unambiguous, no other consideration is at all relevant.\\r\\nThis is the view which has been taken, and in our opinion quite rightly, in a number of cases of the Madras, Patna and Nagput High Courts(1).\\r\\nWe are not unmindful of the fact that a contrary view has been expressed in certain decisions of the Bombay, Lahore and Allahabad High Courts (2).\\r\\nThe line of reasoning that is adopted in most of the decisions where the contrary view is taken can be thus stated in the language of Mr. Justice Somjee (3):__ \"The Act is not sought to be applied to determine the succession to the stridhan of a Hindu maiden but is sought to be used by the petitioner to ascertain the fourth class of heirs to the stridhan of a Hindu maiden mentioned at page 139 of Mulla \\'s Hindu Law.\\r\\nThe heirs of the father at the time of her death have to be ascertained in accordance with the Hindu Law as it existed at the time of the death of Bai Champubai.\\r\\nThus the Act comes into operation for ascer taining the order in which the heirs of her father would be entitled to succeed to his estate, because the heirs of the father (1) Vide Manda Mahalakshmamma vs Mantravadi (I.L.R. ; Shakuntalabai vs Court of Wards (I.L.R. 1942 Nag. 629); Talukraj Kuer vs Bacha Kuer (I.L.R. 26 Pat.\\r\\n150); Kuppuswami v Manickasari (A.I.R.

Setalvad (Ram Ditta Mal and B. Sen, with hirn) for the respondents.\\r\\nDecember 21.\\r\\nThe Court delivered judgment as follows : KANIA C.J. This is an appeal from a judgment of the High Court at Bombay.\\r\\nAlthough the record is heavy and many points were argued in the trial court and in the court of appeal at Bombay, the important point argued before us is only one.\\r\\nThe appellants (plaintiffs) are a firm of commission agents in Bombay.\\r\\nThe respondents (defendants) 982 were their constituents.\\r\\nAccounts between the parties in respect of their dealings were made up and settled up to the 30th of October, 1943.\\r\\nPiecegoods and yarn continued to be purchased and consigned by the plaintiffs to the defendants joint family firm thereafter.\\r\\nOne bale of piecegoods was purchased and despatched in November, 1943.\\r\\nIn January, 1944, restrictions were imposed against the consignment of piecegoods and/or yarn outside Bombay by rail without.\\r\\nobtaining the necessary previous permit from the Textile Commissioner at Bombay.\\r\\nOn or about the 8th February, 1944, Mohanlal of the defendants \\' joint family firm came to Bombay and the plaintiffs purchased on their behalf 278 bales of piecegoods.\\r\\nNinetyfour out of those were despatched accord ing to the defendants \\' instructions.\\r\\nThe plaintiffs, accord ing to the defendants \\' instructions, applied for and ob tained permit to consign several more bales.\\r\\nOn the permits being issued they were despatched on 14th February, 1944, to destinations given by the defendants.\\r\\nOn the 10th April, 1944, the plaintiffs, after obtaining the necessary permits, despatched more bales as directed by the defendants.\\r\\nThe dispute between the parties relates to the remaining 92 bales which were stored in godown No. 424, Baroda Street, Argyle Road, Bombay, pending the receipt of permit for consigning the same On the 14th April, 1944, there occurred a big explosion in the Bombay harbour which destroyed several immovable proper ties and godowns with moveable property covering a large area near the port.\\r\\nFires were caused by the explosion and they also caused considerable destruction of moveable and immoveable properties.\\r\\nThese 92 bales purchased by the plaintiffs on account of the defendants were also destroyed either by the fire or the explosion.\\r\\nThe plaintiffs filed a suit to recover the price of these 9 \\'2 bales from the de fendants on the ground of the agent \\'s right to indemnity.\\r\\nThe defendants contended that the plaintiffs were their pucca adatiyas, that the property in the goods did not pass to them and that they were not liable for the price 983 till delivery of the goods was given to them.\\r\\nIn the alter native, in para.\\r\\n4 of their written statement, they pleaded that when Mohanlal of the defendants \\' firm was in Bombay and the plaintiffs stated that the goods could not be railed until permits were obtained, it was agreed between the plaintiffs and the defendants that the defendants were to pay annas four per bale per month to the plaintiffs for insurance charges and the goods were thus to remain insured till despatched according to their instructions.\\r\\nIn para graph 21 of their written statement, they contended that if their plea that the plaintiffs were pucca adatiyas was not accepted.\\r\\nand the plaintiffs were held to be their commis sion agents, the plaintiffs were guilty of negligence and misconduct in the business of agency, as in spite of specific instructions and agreement they bad failed to insure the goods.\\r\\nThey contended that owing to this negli gence and misconduct the plaintiffs were not entitled to the indemnity claimed.\\r\\nIn the alternative they contended that the plaintiffs were liable to make good the loss caused to the defendants by their failure to insure the said bales.\\r\\nThey contended that they were entitled to set off this loss against the claim for the price.\\r\\nThey also counterclaimed the same amount if their set off was not allowed.\\r\\nOn these pleadings the parties went to a hearing.\\r\\nIssue to covered the defendants \\' plea about the plaintiffs \\' negligence and misconduct in not insuring the 92 bales and the counter claim arising therefrom.\\r\\nNumerous witnesses were called before the trial court and the learned judge after considering their demeanour and hearing their evidence came to the conclusion that the plaintiffs \\' witnesses were unreliable, except when they were corroborated by documentary evidence.\\r\\nHe also disbelieved the defendants \\' evidence.\\r\\nHe held that the agreement to insure the goods was not proved and passed a decree in favour of the plaintiffs.\\r\\nOn appeal, differing from the view of the trial court, the appeal court held that instruc tions were given by Mohanlal to insure the goods and that 984 the agreement was proved.\\r\\nIn thus differing from the trial court \\'s decision, they accepted the well recognised princi ple to give full weight to the trial judge \\'s observations about the witness.\\r\\nThey however found that on the documents the view of the learned trial judge was not correct.\\r\\nIn doing so, they principally relied on statements of account sent by the plaintiffs to the defendants in respect of bales purchased in February, 1944, and despatched by them out of the lot of 278 bales previously and where the plaintiffs had charged the defendants insurance premia at the rates men tioned in the defendants \\' written statement.\\r\\nThey rejected the plaintiffs \\' explanation, which was accepted by the trial judge, that these entries were foolishly made out of cupidity by the plaintiffs.\\r\\nAfter a brief discussion in which this point was halt ingly urged before us, the learned counsel for the plain tiffs did not very properIy dispute this conclusion of the appeal court.\\r\\nIn our opinion, the finding of the appeal court, having regard to the documents, was correct.\\r\\nThat left for decision the important question of damages to which the respondents were entitled.\\r\\nBefore the appel late court in Bombay, it was conceded by the respondents \\' counsel that the insurance which was to be effected by the appellants under the agreement was on the usual terms of fire insurance policies prevalent in Bombay.\\r\\nClause 7 of that form of policy, inter alia, provided as follows : \"Unless otherwise expressly stated in the policy, this insurance does not cover. (h) any loss or damage occasioned by or through or in consequence of explosion but loss or damage by explosion of gas used for illuminating or domestic purposes in a building in which gas is not generated and which does not form part of any gaswork will be deemed to be lost by fire within the meaning of this policy \" The appellants urged that granting that they were in default and had committed a breach of duty in not 985 insuring the goods according to the instructions or the agreement, the respondents could not recover anything from them due to damage arising from the explosion, because the policy of fire insurance, if taken out, would not have given to the respondents the money claimed by them.\\r\\nFor this purpose they relied on a statement n Mayne on Damages, (11th Ed.) at page 592, as follows : \"Therefore if an agent is ordered to procure a policy of insurance for his principal and neglects to do it, and yet the policy, if procured, would not have entitled the princi pal, in the events which have happened, to recover the loss or damage, the agent may avail himself of that as a complete defence.\\r\\n\" In the present case, after the explosion considerable discussion about the liability of the insurance companies under their policies of fire insurance and the liability of Government for alleged negligence in unloading high explosives from a ship on the docks appears to have taken place.\\r\\nOn the 1st of July, 1944, the Governor General pro mulgated the Bombay Explosion (Compensation) (Ordinance, 1944.\\r\\nThe preamble to that Ordinance runs as follows: \" Whereas an emergency has arisen which makes it neces sary to provide for and regulate the payment of compensation for. damage to property due to, or arising out of, the explosions and fires which occurred in the Bombay Docks on the 14th April, 1944, to restrict litigation in connec tion with the said explosions and fires and to make certain other provisions in connection therewith.\\r\\n\" The other relevant provisions may be also noticed at this stage.\\r\\nUninsured property was defined to mean property which was not covered whether wholly or partially by any policy of fire, marine or miscellaneous insurance at the time of the explosion.\\r\\nAfter providing for the procedure according to which compensation may be claimed and dealt with by the Claims Committee to be set up under the Ordi nance and an appeal and review from their decision, section 14 provided as follows : 986 14.\\r\\n\"Subject to the provisions of this Ordinance, there shall be paid by the Central Government compensation for explosion damage to property being (a) damage caused by fire to property insured whether wholly or partially at the time of the explosion against fire under a policy (other than a policy of marine insur ance) covering fire risk, or damage caused by blast without fire intervening to property insured whether wholly or partially at the time of the explosion under a pollcy (other than a policy of marine insurance) covering fire and explo sion risks, of an amount equal to the proved loss, or (b) damage caused by blast without fire intervening to property insured whether wholly or partially at the time of the explosion against fire under a policy (other than a policy of marine insurance) covering fire risk but not explosion risk, of an amount equal to 871/2 per centum of the proved loss, to the holder of the policy of insurance covering the damaged property, or if he is deceased, to his legal representatives.\\r\\nSection 15 provided for contribution by the insurers towards the payment of amounts to be paid under the Ordi nance.\\r\\nSection 18 of the Ordinance runs as follows : 18.\\r\\n(1) Nothing in this Ordinance shall prevent the recovery of compensation for death or personal injury under the (V/11 of 1923), or under any policy of life insurance or against personal accident or under any other contract or scheme providing for the payment of compensation for death or personal injury, or for damage toproperry under any policy \\' of marine or miscel laneous insurance.\\r\\n(2) Save as provided in sub section (1), no person shall have, or be deemed ever to have had, otherwise than under this Ordinance any right whether in contract or in tort or otherwise to any compensation or damages for any death, personal injury or damage to or loss of any property, rights or interests, due to or in any way arising out of the explo sion; and no suit or other 987.\\r\\nlegal proceedings for any such compensation or damages shall, save as aforesaid, be maintainable in any Court against the Crown or the Trustees of the Port of Bombay or the Municipal Corporation of the City of Bombay or against any servants or agents of the Crown or of the said Trustees or Municipal Corporation or againt any other person whomso ever; and no act or omission which caused or contributed to the explosion shall be deemed to have been done or omitted to be done otherwise than lawfully.\\r\\n(3) No suit, prosecution or other legal proceeding whatsoever shall lie against any person for anything in good faith done or ordered to be done in combating or mitigating the effects of the explosion, or for anything in good faith done or intended to be done in pursuance of this Ordinance or any rules or orders made thereunder.\\r\\n\" It is common ground that in respect of uninsured merch andise fifty per cent.\\r\\ncompensation was to be paid under the Ordinance.\\r\\nThe appellants have recovered that amount and have now agreed to give credit of the same to the re spondents.\\r\\nThe dispute is in respect of the remaining fifty per cent.\\r\\nIt is not disputed that if the goods had been insured, under section 14 of the Ordinance, full compensa tion would have been recovered by the appellants and become payable to the respondents.\\r\\nThe appellants \\' contention is two fold.\\r\\nFirstly, that if they had insured the goods the ordinary fire insurance policy would not have covered the risk and therefore al though they had committed a breach of the agreement or been negligent in their duty as agents, they were not liable to pay anything more to the respondents.\\r\\nIn the alternative it was argued on their behalf that the intervention of Govern ment in passing this Ordinance could not increase or add to the liability of the appellants for the breach of contract or breach of duty and therefore they were not liable to pay the compensation which would have been receivable by the respondents if the goods had been 988 insured.\\r\\nThe second contention is that the counterclaim of the respondents is barred under section 18 (2) o[ the Ordi nance.\\r\\nIn the Indian Contract Act, sections 211 and 212 provide for the consequences of an agent acting otherwise than according to his duty towards the principal.\\r\\nUnder section 211 when an agent conducts the business of the principal otherwise than according to the directions given by the principal, ii any loss be sustained he must make it good to his principal and if any profit accrues he must account for it.\\r\\nIn Smith vs Lascelles(1), it was held that if an agent was instructed to insure goods and neglected to do so he was liable to the principal for their value in the event of their being lost.\\r\\nSection 212 of the Indian Con tract Act provides as follows : \"An agent is always bound to act with reasonable dili gence and use such skill as he possesses; to make compensa tion to his principal in respect of the direct consequences of is own neglect, want of skill or misconduct, but not in respect of loss or damage which are indirectly or remotely caused by such neglect, want of skill or misconduct.\\r\\n\" These sections make it clear that in case of the agent \\'s negligence he is liable to make good the damage directly arising from his neglect but not indirectly or remotely caused by such neglect or misconduct.\\r\\nThe question there fore is whether in the present case the claim of the re spondents based on the neglect or misconduct can be stated to be a direct consequence of such neglect or misconduct or is only indirectly or remotely caused by such neglect.\\r\\nTwo positions can be visualized as arising from the appellants \\' neglect in this case.\\r\\nThe appellants could be treated either as insurers themselves or can be considered as having agreed to cause the goods insured by a recognised insurance company on the usual fire insurance policy terms.\\r\\nIn Tickel vs Short(2), the Lord Chancellor shortly stated the proposition of law in these terms : \" The rule of equity is, that if an order (1) ; (2) 2 Ves.\\r\\nSen, 239.\\r\\n989 is sent by a principal to a factor to make an insurance; and he charges his principal, as i[ it was made; if he never in fact has made that insurance, he is considered as the insur er himself\" If therefore, as in the present case, the appel lants were given instructions to insure the goods and they charged the respondents as if they had insured the goods, the law would throw upon them the liability of an insurer as if they stood in the position of insurers, i.e., the Court will then be entitled in equity to proceed on the footing as if an insurance had been effected by the appellants and the goods stood covered under a fire insurance policy.\\r\\nWhatever consequences follow from that position must be accepted and enforced in a court of equity against the appellants.\\r\\nProceeding on that line of reasoning under section 14 of the Ordinance the only thing which is required to be considered is whether the goods were covered by a fire insurance policy.\\r\\nThe terms of the policy are immaterial.\\r\\nIf, therefore, the appellants are considered as having insured the goods and are precluded from saying that the goods were not covered by a fire insurance policy, the loss arising from the fact that the goods were not so covered is a direct consequence of their neglect and they must make it good.\\r\\nThat will make them liable to pay what was claimed by the respondents.\\r\\nIf, however, it is considered that they were not them selves insurers but that they had agreed only to keep the goods insured under a policy of insurance of a recognised insurance company on the usual fire insurance policy terms, the question is whether the damages claimed by the respond ents directly flow from their neglect of duty in not being able to produce such a fire insurance policy.\\r\\nOur attention has been drawn to an instructive judgment which makes the distinction between direct and remote damages clear.\\r\\nIn In Re An Arbitration between Polemis & another and Furness Withy & Co. Ltd.(1) there is a discussion on this point in the judgment of Banks L.J.\\r\\nHe drew attention to the obser vations of Lord Sumner in Weld Blundell vs 990 Stephens (1), who observed as follows: \"What are natural, probable and necessary consequences ? Everything that hap pens, happens in the order of nature and is therefore natu ral.\\r\\nNothing that happens by the free choice of a thinking man is necessary except in the sense of pre destination.\\r\\nTo speak of probable consequences is to throw everything upon the jury.\\r\\nIt is tautologous to speak of effective cause or to say that damages too remote from the cause are irrecover able, for an effective cause is simply that which causes, and in law, what is ineffective or too remote is not a cause at all.\\r\\nI still venture to think that direct cause is the best expression. . .\\r\\nWhat a defendant ought to have anticipated as a reasonable man is material when the question is whether or not he was guilty of negligencee that is, of want of due care according to the circumstances; This however goes to capability, not to compensation.\\r\\n\" Banks L.J., after noticing the above observations, stated as follows : \" Under these circumstances I consider that it is immaterial that the causing of the spark by the falling of the plank could not have been reasonably anticipated.\\r\\nThe appellants \\' junior counsel sought to draw a distinction between the anticipation of the extent of damage resulting from a negligent act, and the anticipation of the type of damage resulting from such an act. .\\r\\nI do not think that the distinction can be admitted.\\r\\nGiven the breach of duty which constitutes the negligence, and given the duty damage as a direct result of that negligence, the anticipations of the person whose negligent act has produced the damage appear to me to be irrelevant,\" The question of what is remoteness of damages in a case of negligence has been reviewed in detail in a recent deci sion of the House of Lords in Monarch Steamship Co. Ltd. vs Karlshamns Oljefabriker(2).\\r\\nIn that case the question arose in respect of damages due to the late delivery of goods shipped for a port in Sweden, but which ship, owing to its unseaworthiness, was delayed in its voyage and owing to the outbreak of war (1) (2) , 991 under orders of the British Admiralty, was directed not to proceed to the Swedish port but ordered to discharge the cargo at Glasgow.\\r\\nThe assignees of the bills of lading from the shippers had to forward the goods in neutral ships chartered for the purpose to the Swedish port.\\r\\nA war risks clause in the charterparty exonerated the owners of the vessel in the event of compliance with any orders given by the government of the nation under whose flag the ship sailed, as to destination delivery or otherwise.\\r\\nThe hold ers of the bills of lading claimed the re transport charges from Glasgow to the Swedish port.\\r\\nIt was contended that these damages were too remote.\\r\\nThe House of Lords rejected the contention.\\r\\nIn the speech of Lord Wright most of the relevant authorities have been reviewed and the ratio decidendi has been set out.\\r\\nIn Hadley vs Baxendale (1) Alderson B., giving the judgment of the CoUrt, thought that the proper rule in such a case consisted of two alternatives.\\r\\nHe said: \"Where two parties have made a contract which one of them has broken the damages which the other party ought to receive in respect of such breach of contract should be such as may fairly and reasonably be considered either arising naturally, i.e., according to the usual course of things, from such breach of contract itself, or such as may reasonably be supposed to have been in the contemplation of both parties at the time they made the contract, as the probable result of the breach of it.\" In the opinion of Lord Wright this in truth gives effect to the broad general rule of the law of damages that a party injured by the other party \\'s breach of contract \"is entitled to such money compensation as will put him in the position in which he would have been but for the breach.\" This rule was stated by Lord Blackburn in Livingstone vs Rawyards Coal Co. (2) as follows : \"Where any injury is to be compensated by damages, in settling the sum of money to be given for reparation of damages you should as nearly as possible get at that sum of money which will put the party who has been injured, (1) ; (2) , 39. 992 or who has suffered, in the same position as he would have been in if he had not sustained the wrong for which he is now getting his compensation or reparation.\\r\\n\" The \\'rule stated by Alderson B. has consistently been accepted as correct;the only difficulty has been in applying it.\\r\\nThe distinction drawn is between damages arising naturally (which means in the normal course of things) and cases where there were special and ex traordinary circumstances beyond the reasonable prevision of the parties.\\r\\nThe dis tinction between these types is usually described in English Law as that between generaland special damages; the latter are such that if they are not communicated it would not be fair or reasonable to hold the defendant responsible for losses which he could not be taken to contemplate as likely to result from his breach of contract.\\r\\nViscount Haldane L.C. in The British Westinghouse Electric & Manufacturing Co. Ltd. v, The Underground Electric Railways Co. of London (1), on the question of damages said :In some of the cases there are expressions as to the principles governing the measure of general damages which at first sight seem difficult to harmonize.\\r\\nThe apparent discrepancies are, however, mainly due to the varying nature of the particular questions submitted for decision.\\r\\nThe quantum of damage is a question of fact, and the only guidance the law can give is to lay down general principles which afford at times but scanty assistance.in dealing with particular cases.\\r\\nThe Judges who give guidance to juries in these cases have necessarily to look at their special character, and to mould, for the purposes of different kinds of claim, the expression of the general principles which apply to them and this is apt to give rise to an appearance of ambiguity. .It was necessary to balance loss and gain and no simple solution was possi ble.\\r\\n\" The House of Lords in Liesbosch (Owners) vs Edison (Owners) (2) has stated at page 463 that it is impossible to lay down any universal formula.\\r\\nThe dominant rule of law is the principle of restitutio in integrum and subsidiary rules can only be justified if (1) 689.\\r\\n(2) ; , 993 they give, effect to that rule.\\r\\n(The italics are mine).\\r\\nIn Smith, Hogg & Co. Lid.\\r\\nvs Black Sea & Baltic General Insurance Co. Ltd. (1), the loss of a vessel occurred through the negligence of the master operating on conditions of unseaworthiness existing since the com mencement of the voyage.\\r\\nThe loss was held to be caused by the breach of the warranty of seaworthiness and recoverable accordingly.\\r\\nThere was an exception of negligence.\\r\\nAt page 1005 in the judgment of that case it is stated \"no distinction could be drawn between cases where the negligent conduct of the master is a cause and cases where any other cause, such as perils of the sea, is a co operating cause.\\r\\nA negligent act is as much a co operating cause if it is a cause at all.\\r\\n, as an act which is not negligent.\\r\\n\" What was then being emphasized was that a voluntary act (negligent or not) of a human agent is not generally an independent or new cause for this purpose which breaks the chain of causation, as it is called, so as to exclude from consideration the causal effect of the unsea worthiness.\\r\\nIn that case it was held that the unseaworthi ness created in the vessel instability which, combined with negligence of the master, caused the loss.\\r\\nNo new law was laid down in that case.\\r\\nSimilarly in The Standard Oil Co. o[ New York vs Clan Line Steamers Ltd. C\"), the vessel capsized because the master not being instructed by his owners as to the peculiarities of a turret ship, so handled her that she capsized.\\r\\nThat loss was immediately due to perils of the sea which overwhelmed her when she capsized, liability for which was excepted, but the dominant cause was her unseaworthiness in that her master, though \\' otherwise efficient, was inefficient in not being aware of the special danger.\\r\\nIn general, all the authorities are in agreement in this respect and embody the same rule.\\r\\nTIm shipowner, of course, under the familiar general rule, is debarred by his breach of duty from relying on the specific exception.\\r\\nThough he would not be liable for the conse quences caused by the specific excepted peril or the acci dent alone if he (1)[1940] A.G. 997.\\r\\n(2) 994 were not in default, though the unseaworthiness existing at the commencement Of the voyage might not be operative or known until the time when the accident occurs, yet then the breach of the warranty operates directly as a cause and, indeed, a dominant cause.\\r\\nCausation in law does not depend on remoteness or immediacy in time,\" These observations meet the appellants \\' contention about the Government Ordinance intervening to fix the damages.\\r\\nThey show that such inter vention does not break the chain of causation, nor does it make the loss, i.e., damages, remote.\\r\\nThe statement of law in Mayne on Damages quoted above, only reproduces the prin ciple of law stated by Lord Blackburn in Livingstone vs Rawyards Coat Company(1).\\r\\nBearing in mind this state of the law itappears clear that in the present case it was the duty of the appellants to insure the goods, as they had agreed to do.\\r\\nOnce miscon duct is admitted or proved, the fact that the Ordinance did not exist and could not have been in the contemplation of the parties is irrelevant for deciding the question of liability.\\r\\nThe liability was incurred by reason of the breach of their duty and the appellants made themselves liable to pay damages.\\r\\nThe measure of damages was the loss suffered by the respondents on account of the goods not being insured.\\r\\nThe next point to be decided is what differ ence the promulgation of the Ordinance makes in the liabili ty of the appellants.\\r\\nThe relevant provisions are noted above.\\r\\nThe scheme of the Ordinance clearly is, as stated in the preamble, to provide for and regulate the payment of compensation and to prevent litigation, amongst other things.\\r\\nIt is thus a comprehensive legislation which re places the rights of parties either under the policy of insurance against insurance companies, or on the ground of negligence against Government by the owners of the goods, as also claims by insurance companies against Government.\\r\\nThe validity of this legislation is not challenged.\\r\\nSection 18 gives it a retrospective effect.\\r\\nTherefore the Ordinance only (1) 995 substitutes a new basis for assessing compensation for the ordinary basis for assessing unliquidated damages.\\r\\nThe compensation under the Ordinance is payable on proof of the existence of a fire insurance policy irrespective of the terms of the policy.\\r\\nThe non recovery of half the amount of the respondents \\' claim from the Government under the Ordi nance because of the absence of a fire insurance policy, thus directly arises from the neglect of the appellants to insure the goods, as they had been instructed to do or agreed to do and which in fact they represented that they had done.\\r\\nIn our opinion, these are not indirect or remote damages.\\r\\nThe contention that under the policy of insurance the assured could not have recovered anything for loss caused by the fire due to explosion cannot be accepted.\\r\\nFirstly, this contention of the assured \\'s inability to receive any compen sation because of clause 7 of the form of common policy was not raised in the trial court.\\r\\nNo issue was raised in re spect thereof and no arguments in support or against it were heard.\\r\\nIt was suggested for the first time, as appears from the judgment of Chagla J., in the court of appeal.\\r\\nThe assumption that because of clause 7 of the policy no insur ance company would have paid the loss cannot be assumed to be necessarily and unquestionably sound and in view of the terms of the Ordinance not capable of being determined.\\r\\nThere appears no reason under the circumstances to proceed as if an adverse decision on the interpretation of the policy had been given against the respondents and to hold the appellants free from liability for not recovering half the value of the goods which could have been recovered if the goods had been insured (irrespective of the terms on which the policy stood) as agreed to be done by them.\\r\\nI do not think when the relations between the parties are of a principal and an agent and the agent is found to have com mitted a breach of his duty, it is correct to take a narrow view of the situation.\\r\\nThe agent chose to gamble in not insuring the goods and desired to charge the agreed premia, on the footing that the goods were covered by insurance.\\r\\nIf so, he must take the 996 consequences of his default.\\r\\nThe argument that their li ability as an agent who had agreed to insure should be ascertained as on the date of the explosion is no answer to the claim of the respondents.\\r\\nThe position would be this.\\r\\nAssuming that the appellants had insured the goods on the terms of the usual fire insurance policy. the respondents could ask them either to assign the policy to the respond ents or to file a suit against the insurance company con tending that the fire, and not the explosion, was the; cause of the loss and was covered by the policy of insurance.\\r\\nBefore the Court could decide the rights of the parties, the Ordinance promulgated by the Governor General prevented the decision of the dispute, but the Government undertook to pay the loss on the footing that the policy covered the risk.\\r\\nTile misconduct gave rise to the liability to make good the damage and to put the respondents in the same position in which they would have been if their goods had beeen insured.\\r\\nOn behalf of the appellants it was urged that because of the Government intervention in issuing the Ordinance they were sought to be made liable under a new liability.\\r\\nTheir liability has been and exists on the basis that a fire insurance policy existed, as they were instructed to insure the goods and which they represented they had done.\\r\\nThe liability arises not because of the Ordinance but because of the breach of their duty in failing to insure, which has taken place apart from the Ordinance and which is not af fected by the Ordinance.\\r\\nThe utmost that they could urge is that the extent of their liability arising from their mis conduct was not anticipated by them when they agreed to perform their duty.\\r\\nThat however is no defence in law if the damages directly flow from the breach of duty.\\r\\nThe Ordinance only quantifies the damages instead of leaving the unliqui dated damages to be assessed in the usual way.\\r\\nThe Ordi nance lays down the yardstick for fixing the damages under different circumstances, which cover all alternative situa tions, and the liability for failure to insure must now be measured by the new basis.\\r\\nIt does not create any new li ability.\\r\\n997 The appellants \\' contention on this point therefore must be rejected.\\r\\nThe only other point urged before us was based on the construction of section 18 of the Ordinance.\\r\\nIt was argued on behalf of the appellants that apart from what could be recovered under clause (1) of section 18, the Ordinance extinguished all right, whether in contract or tort or otherwise, to any compensation or damage for loss of an), property due to, or in any way arising out of, the explosion and provided that no suit or other legal proceedings for any such compensation or damages shall, save as aforesaid, be maintainable in any court against the Crown or against any other person whatsoever.\\r\\nIt was urged that in establishing their claim, the respondents must plead the right to recover the amount due to explosion and that was barred under sec tion 18 (2).\\r\\nIn our opinion, this contention is unsound.\\r\\nThe appellants have filcd this suit to recover the price of the goods on the ground of indemnity.\\r\\nThe respondents \\' answer is that the appellants are not entitled to the indem nity because they are guilty of a breach of duty in the business of the agency.\\r\\nThey contend that they would be liable to pay for the goods only if the appellants give them the goods or deliver the same according to their instruc tions.\\r\\nThey counterclaim that if the appellants are unable to give them the goods, they must pay them the value there of.\\r\\nThe appellants plead by way of defence to the counter claim that the goods were destroyed without any neglect on their part by fire caused by the explosion and therefore they were not liable.\\r\\nThe respondents \\' rejoinder is that they had asked the appellants to insure the goods and if the appellants had not failed in their duty they would have reimbursed the respondents.\\r\\nThe appellants then plead that even if they had insured the goods the respondents could not have recovered anything from the insurance companies.\\r\\nIt is in reply to this contention that the respondents say that the appellants \\' liability to recover money from the insur ance company on the terms of the usual fire insurance policy is irrelevant 998 because they could have recovered the money if they had insured in fact, irrespective of the terms of the policy, under the Ordinance.\\r\\nThe respondents are not thus claiming to recover money from the appellants otherwise than under section 18 (1) of the Ordinance.\\r\\nTheir cause of action is the misconduct of the agent in the business of agency and is quite different.\\r\\nIt is not for compensation arising from explosion.\\r\\nIt was argued that damages formed part of the cause of action of the respondents in framing the counterclaim and therefore section 18 (2) stood in the way of the respond ents.\\r\\nThe contention is unsound because the cause of action is completed by the averment that there was a duty or agree ment to insure, that there was a failure to perform that duty, that loss had occasioned to the respondents because of the failure to perform the duty and the appellants were therefore liable for the breach of the duty.\\r\\nThe quantum of damages is not a part of the cause of action.\\r\\nIt is a matter to be ascertained by the court according to well laid down principles of law.\\r\\nThe result is that the appeal fails and is dismissed with costs.\\r\\nPATANJALI SASTRI J.\\r\\nI regret I am unable to agree with the judgment just delivered by my Lord which I have had an opportunity of reading.\\r\\nAs the facts of the case have been fully stated in that judgment it is unnecessary to re state them here.\\r\\nThe main question arising for determination is what damages are the appellants liable to pay to the respondents for their failure to insure the respondents \\' goods which were destroyed by fire caused by the big explosions which occurred in the Bombay Docks on 14th April, 1944 ? The goods had been purchased by the appellants in Bombay as the commission agents of the respondents and were left in their godowns pending their despatch to the respondents \\' place of business.\\r\\nIt was found by the appellate bench of the Court below that the appellants had agreed to keep \\'the goods insured against fire while in their custody 999 and had debited the respondents in their books with the insurance charges.\\r\\nA suggestion was made in the course of the arguments before us that the appellants agreed to be the insurers themselves, but the findings of the appellate bench leave no room for doubt that all that the appellants agreed to do was to procure a policy of fire insurance in the ordinary or common form and subject to the conditions usual ly stipulated in that form of policy.\\r\\nThis is also made clear by the concession of the respondents \\' counsel in the court below that \"he was only relying on the agreement to the extent that the insurance was to be effected against fire on an ordinary fire insurance policy\".\\r\\nIt is common ground that one of the general conditions in that form of policy is that \"it does not cover\" among others any loss or damage occasioned by or through or in consequence of explo sion\".\\r\\nRelying on that condition, it was contended for the appellants that even if they had effected an insurance on the goods according to the agreement, the loss of the goods by fire caused by the explosion would have been an excluded loss for which no damages could have been claimed from the insurer and that, therefore, the respondents would not be entitled to recover from the appellants anything more than nominal damages for failure to insure.\\r\\nThis contention must, in my opinion, prevail.\\r\\nAs pointed out by Mr. Mayne in his Treatise on Damages (p. 591, 11th Edition) \"When the agent can show that under no circumstances could any benefit to the principal have followed from obedience to his orders, and therefore that disobedience to them has produced no real injury, the action will fail.\\r\\nThere fore, if an agent is ordered to procure a policy of insurance for his principal, and neglects to do it, and yet the policy, if procured, would not have entitled the principal, in the events which have happened, to recover the loss or damage, the agent may avail himself of that as a complete defence.\" A complication, however, is introduced by an Ordinance promulgated by the Governor General known as the Bombay Explosion (Compensation) 1000 Ordinance (No. 32 of 1944) which came into force on 1st July, 1944.\\r\\nThe preamble states \\',Whereas an emergency has arisen which makes it necessary to provide for and regulate the payment of compensation for. . damage to property due to, or arising out of, the explosions and fires which occurred in the Bombay Docks on 14th April, 1944, to re strict litigation in connection with the said explosions. \".\\r\\nBy section 2 \"the explosion\" is defined as meaning \"the explosions which occurred in the Bombay Docks on 14th April, 1944, and the fire.\\r\\nwhich ensued there from.\\r\\n\" An \"explosion damage\" is defined as \"damage which occurred, whether accidentally or not, as the direct result of the explosion. \" \"Uninsured proPerty means \"pro perty which was not covered whether wholly or partially by an policy of fire, marine or miscellaneous explosion\" Section 14 insurance at the time of tile 1 . . so far as it is material here, provides that \"there shall be paid by the Central Government compensation for explosion damage to property, being damage caused by fire to property insured whether wholly or partially at the time of the explosion against fire under a policy covering fire risk. of an amount equal to the proved loss.\\r\\n\"Section 15 provides for coutribution to Government by insurance compa nies.\\r\\nSection 16 provides for compensation for such damage to uninsured property on a certain scale mentioned in that section.\\r\\nSection 18(2) enacts, subject to certain exccep tions not material here, \"no person shall leave, or be deemed ever to have had, otherwise than under this Ordinance any right, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise to any compensation or damages for any. or damages to or loss of any property, rights or interests.\\r\\ndue to or in any way arising out of the explosion; and no suit or other legal proceedings for any such compensation or damages shall, save as aforesaid.\\r\\nbe maintainable in any court against the Crown. or against any servants or agents of the Crown . or against any other person whomsoever; and no act or omis sion which caused or contributed to the explosion shall be deemed to have been done or omitted to be done otherwise than lawfully.\\r\\n\" 1001 It is admitted that the appellants recovered from the Central Government under section 16 nearly one half of the value of the goods destroyed by fire while in their custody as compensation fox \\' the loss of the respondents \\' goods and have given credit to the respondents in their ac counts for the amount thus received.\\r\\nThe dispute now re lates to the respondents \\' claim to the balance of the value of the goods as damages for the appellants \\' failure to keep them insured according to the agreement between the parties as the full value of the goods and have been obtained from the Government under section 14 without regard to any ex cepted risk if only they had been insured against fire.\\r\\nThe scheme of the Ordinance appears to be that the Government, instead of having probably to fight out numerous law suits for compensation for loss or damage to property based upon alleged negligence of their officers in having allowed the explosion to take pleace, undertook to pay an amount equal to the \"proved loss\" in cases of loss or damage to goods which had been insured against fire, etc.\\r\\nand smaller amounts for loss or damage to uninsured goods, putting an end, at the same time, to all rights to compensation or damages arising out of the explosion, and barring all suits or legal proceedings for the same.\\r\\nOn the basis of these provisions it was contended on behalf of the respondents that the appellants, by reason of their failure to keep the goods insured, were liable under the law to place the respondents, who had suffered the loss, in the same position as if the appellants had performed their agreement or carried out the instructions of the respondents.\\r\\nLearned counsel for the respondents based the claim on the neglect of duty on the part of the appellants as commission agents in carrying out the instructions of their principals, and relied on the provisions of section 212 of the Indian Contract Act, which provides, inter alia, that an agent is bound \"to make compensation to his princi pal in respect of the direct consequence of his own neglect, want of skill or misconduct, but not in respect of loss or damage which are indirectly or remotely 1002 caused by such neglect, want of skill or misconduct.\\r\\n\" On the other hand, it was urged on behalf of the appellants that the question had to be determined on the basis of a breach of contract for the consequences of which provision is made in section 73 of the Indian Contract Act.\\r\\nThat section says that \"when a contract has been broken, the party who suffers by such breach is entitled to receive, from the party who has broken the contract, compensation for any loss or damage caused to him thereby, which natural ly arose in the usual course of things from such breach, or which the parties knew, when they made the contract, to be likely to result from the breach of it.\\r\\nSuch compensation is not to be given for any remote or indirect loss or damage sustained by reason of the breach.\\r\\n\" I do not think that it makes much difference, so far as the assessment of general damages is concerned, whether the default of the appellants is treated as a breath of contract between two contracting parties or a neglect of duty by agents in failing to carry out the instructions of their principal.\\r\\nAlthough the Indian Contract Act makes separate provisions for the consequences in each case, the rule laid down as to measure of damages is s the same, namely, the party in breach must make compen sation in respect of the direct consequences flowing from the breach and not in respect of loss or damage indirectly or remotely caused, which is also the rule in English common law.\\r\\nThe rule is based on the broad principle of restitutio in integrum, that is to say, that the party who has suffered the loss should be placed in the same position, as far as compensation in money can do it, as if the party in breach had performed his contract or fulfilled his duty.\\r\\nThat principle was once carried to its utmost logical, if gro tesque, result as in an old English case to which Willes J. referred in British Columbia Saw Mill Co. vs Nettleship(1): \\' \\' Where a man going, g to be married to an heiress, his horse having cast a shoe on the journey, em ployed a blacksmith who did the work so unskilfully that the horse was lamed, and the rider not having (1) L. L. , 508 1003 arrived in time the lady married another; and the blacksmith was held liable for the loss of the marriage.\\r\\n\" And the learned Judge warned \"We should inevitably fall into a similar absurdity unless we applied the rules of commonsense to restrict the extent of liability for the breach of a contract of this sort.\" The commonsense point of view was thus put by Lord Wright in Liesbosch, Dredger vs Edison S.S. (Owners)(1): ,, The law cannot take account of everything that follows a wrongful act; it regards some subsequent matters as outside the scope of its selection because \\'it were infinite for the law to judge the cause of causes, \\' or consequence of consequences.\\r\\nThus the loss of a ship by collision due to the other vessel \\'s sole fault may force the shipowner into bankruptcy and that again may involve his family in suffering, loss of education or opportunities in life, but no such loss could be recovered from the wrongdo er.\\r\\nIn the varied web of affairs the law must abstract some consequences as relevant, not perhaps on grounds of pure logic but simply for practical reasons.\\r\\n\" These considera tions have led the courts to evolve the qualifying rules of remoteness subject to which alone the broad principle of restitutio in integrum now finds its application.\\r\\nApplying these principles to the facts of the present case, what is the position ? The respondents lost their go ods by fires arising out of the explosion presumably due to the negligent conduct of the Government \\'s officers or serv ants at the docks.\\r\\nEven if the appellants had taken out a fire insurance policy in ordinary form it would not have covered the loss, for fire due to explosion would be an excepted peril.\\r\\nSo, the appellants \\' failure keep the goods insured produced no direct consequence for which damages could in law be claimed.\\r\\nIt is true enough to say that if the appellants had taken out a fire policy covering the goods, the respondents could have obtained the full value of the goods from the Government.\\r\\nBut did the respondents \\' inability to recover such full value from the Government arise directly or naturally in the usual course ; 1004 of things out of the appellants \\' failure to insure? I think not, since independent and disconnected events had to occur to produce the result, viz., the Government \\'s scheme of compensation embodied in the Ordinance, the agreement with the Insurance Companies regarding their contribution, and the consequent distinction made between insured and unin sured property in providing compensation for their loss.\\r\\nSuppose the fire was caused by an explosion due to the negligence of a private individual.\\r\\nThe respondents would have their remedy by suing him for damages.\\r\\nBut if he was insolvent, could the respondents \\' inability to recover damages from him be a direct and natural consequence of the appellants \\' failure to insure ? Surely not, for even if the appellants had insured the goods according to their agree ment with the respondents, the latter would be in no better position.\\r\\nHere, the Government, presumably being satisfied, or at any rate apprehending, that the explosion was due to the negligence of their servants, got the Ordinance passed providing for payment of compensation by the Government on the terms stated therein and at the same time putting an end to all rights to recover compensation save as provided in the Ordinance and barring all suits and other proceedings for that purpose.\\r\\nAs any claim to compensation against the Government must be based upon the negligence of their serv ants, the Government took no note of excepted risks in insurance policies and undertook liability to pay full compensation in case of all insured property, doubtless because, under an arrangement with certain Insurance Compa nies the Government obtained a proportionate contribution as provided for in section 15, though on the hypothesis of their servants \\' negligence their liability in law would be the same in respect of insured and uninsured property.\\r\\nif the Ordinance had provided for partial compensation in both cases, as it would probably have done if the Insurance Companies had not agreed to come into the scheme with their contributions, the respondents could have no claim to recov er the balance from the appellants, 1005 notwithstanding that the supposed direct causal connection between the appellants \\' default and the respondents \\' loss would still be there.\\r\\nThe truth is there was no such con nection and it was because of the provisions of the Ordi nance which made a distinction between insured and uninsured property in the matter of compensation for explosion damage, and barred rights and remedies under the general law in relation theretto, that the respondents were unable to recover the balance of the value of their goods destroyed by fire.\\r\\nBut such inability cannot be regarded as flowing naturally or directly from the appellants \\' default.\\r\\nIt was suggested that the provisions of the Ordinance must be taken to have displaced the ordinary rules of law as to remoteness of damage, as section 18 (2) extinguished, retrospectively from the date of the explosion, all rights and remedies under the general law for obtaining compensa tion for explosion damage and substituted the rights therein provided.\\r\\nThe substituted right to compensation, so far as the Government and insured property were concerned, was not subject to any restrictive conditions in the policies, and therefore, it was claimed, the measure of damages in this case must be determined irrespectively of the existence of the clause excluding \"explosion\" from the scope of the common form of policy.\\r\\nThe argument is, m my opinion, more ingenious than sound.\\r\\nThe short answer to it is that the Ordinance did not purport to displace or supersede any rule of law as to measure of damages or to amend or abrogate any terms in insurance.\\r\\npolicies.\\r\\nThere is nothing in the Ordinance to indicate that the clause excepting explosion contained in the fire insurance policies issued in Bombay should be deemed to be null and void.\\r\\nAs already stated, the Government, having accepted liability for explosion damage, were not really concerned with the restrictive conditions in the policies.\\r\\nTheir liability did not arise out of such policies.\\r\\nIn view of certain Insurance Compa nies having agreed to contribute a certain proportion, the Government undertook liability 1006 to pay full compensation for loss of insured property regardless of the terms o[ insurance, which had no relevance to the liability which they assumed.\\r\\nTo suggest, in such circumstances, that the clause excepting explosion risk in all fire policies issued in common form in Bombay was legis latively abrogated is, in my opinion, extravagant and far fetched.\\r\\nThe respondents \\' goods were destroyed when the explosion occurred on the 14th April, 1944, and on that date they could have recovered nothing except perhap snominal damages for the appellants \\' failure to insure the goods as they agreed to do.\\r\\nIt is difficult to see how by virtue of the Ordinance passed more than two months later, their claim against the appellants, which the re spondents themselves are contending is not in any way af fected by the provisons of the Ordinance, could become enlarged.\\r\\nThe next contention raised on behalf of the apellants before us relates to the maintainability of the respondents \\' coun ter claim The contention is based upon section 18 (2) of the Ordinance which provides that \"no suit or other legal proceedings for any such compensation or damages\" (i.e., compensation or damages for any damage to or loss of any property, rights or interests due to or in any way arising out of the explosion)\"shall, save as aforesaid\" (exception snot material here) \"be maintainable in any court against the Crown . . or against any other person whoms oever. \".\\r\\nThe learned Chief Justice in the Court below makes no reference in his judgment to this contention, but Chagla J. repelled it thus.\\r\\n\"Now, in my opinion, the defendants \\' claim does not arise out of the explosion nor is it in any way due to the explosion.\\r\\nThe plaintiffs have filed the suit as agents on an indemnity and the defendants \\' answer is that they were entitled to set off against the amounts due to the plaintiffs, the loss incurred by them by reason of the fact that the plaintiffs as the defendants \\' agents did not carry out the defendants \\' instructions.\\r\\nIf the plaintiffs \\' claim on the indemnity does not arise out of the explosion equally so does the defendants \\' set 1007 off not so arise.\\r\\nThe defendants \\' cause of action is fail ure by the plaintiffs to carry out their instructions and that cause of action has nothing whatever to do with the explosion \\'\".\\r\\nWith all respect I find it difficult to follow this reasoning.\\r\\nThe appellants \\' claim on the indemnity does not certainly arise out of the explosion, for their case is that they purchased the goods in question paying the price on the respondents \\' instructions, and they claim to recover the price so paid notwithstanding the destroction of the goods by fire for which they say they were in no way respon sible.\\r\\nBut the basis of the respondents \\' counter claim is quite different.\\r\\nThey say that if the appellants had kept the goods insured according to the agreement, they (the respondents) could have recovered the full value of the goods from the Government under section 14 of the Ordinance, and the appellants, having failed to do so, are liable to pay by way of damages the balance of the value of the goods.\\r\\nIt is a little difficult to see how it could be said that the respondents \\' claim \"does not arise out of the explosion nor is it in any way due to the explosion\".\\r\\nThe bar under section 18 is not based upon the nature of the cause of action for the suit or proceeding barred, but upon the damage or loss of property having been \"due to or in any way arising out of\" the explosion.\\r\\nIndeed, the respondents appear to my mind to be in a dilemma in regard to this point.\\r\\nThey must necessarily say, in order to have been able to claim the full value of the goods from the Government if they had been insured, that the damage to the goods was \"explosion damage to property, being damage caused by fire to property insured whether wholly or partially at the time of the explosion against fire under a policy covering fire risk\".\\r\\nFor, unless they said that, no claim could be made against the Government under section 14, and so the very basis of their claim against the appellants that, but for the appellants \\' neglect of duty, the respondents could have recovered the full value of the goods from the Govern ment, would fail.\\r\\nBut if they had to say that the goods were lost by explosion damage within the meaning 1008 of section 14, it seems to me, they would be bringing them selves under the bar of section 18 (2).\\r\\nThe respondents cannot therefore claim that the loss of the goods was explo sion damage within the meaning of the Ordinance so as to bring the case within section 14 and at the same time con tend that the loss was not \"due tO or did not in any way arise out of the explosion\" in order to avoid the bar under section 18.\\r\\nBoth section 14 and section 18 have in view the physical cause for the loss or damage to property for which compensation is claimed and not the cause of action in relation to the person against whom relief is sought.\\r\\nThe respondents cannot, in my opinion, be allowed to take up inconsistent positions in order to bring themselves within the one and to get out of the other.\\r\\nI would therefore allow the appeal and dismiss the counter claim.\\r\\nDAS J. agreed with the Chief Justice.\\r\\nAppeal dismissed.\\r\\nAgent for the respondents:/.

Shastri for the appellant.\\r\\nHardyal Hardy for the respondent.\\r\\nFebruary 22.\\r\\nThe Judgment of the Court was deliv ered by BOSE J.\\r\\nThis is a defendant \\'s appeal in a suit on two mortgages.\\r\\nThe first was executed on the 7th of April, 1931, by the defendant and his father.\\r\\nThe second was dated the 17th of December, 1935, and was executed by the defend ant alone.\\r\\nThe first was for a sum of Rs, 9,500, the second for Rs. 3,500.\\r\\nThe same property was mortgaged each time.\\r\\nThe claim on the two deeds together was for Rs. 20,774 3 0.\\r\\nThese mortgages were in favour of one Narayan Gopal Sathe.\\r\\nOn the 28th of March, 1940, the mortgagee assigned them both to the plaintiff who now sues on them.\\r\\nThe defence was that both mortgages were satisfied.\\r\\nThe main evidence on which the defendant relied to prove satisfaction was an agreement dated the 17th of October, 1937, executed by the mortgagee Narayan Gopal Sathe in favour of the defendant.\\r\\nThe document has been excluded from evidence by the trial Court as well as by the High Court on appeal on the ground that it required registration.\\r\\nIf this document is excluded, then there is a concurrent finding of fact by both the Courts that the rest of the evidence is not good enough to prove satisfaction.\\r\\nThey have disbelieved it and decreed the plaintiff \\'s claim in full.\\r\\nThe only ques tions before us are (1) whether this document required registration and (2) whether, if it did, it 493 cannot still be used for what the defendant claims is a collateral purpose, namely proving full payment of the mortgage amount.\\r\\nThe agreement came about in this fashion.\\r\\nThe mortga gee, Narayan Sathe, was appointed Receiver of two Cinemas in Poona.\\r\\nThe Court appointing him required him to produce a surety in the sum of Rs. 10,000.\\r\\nThe defendant agreed to undertake this responsibility and as a consideration for that the mortgagee executed the agreement in question.\\r\\nThe portions of the document relevant for the present purpose are as follows.\\r\\nThe mortgages are there described as the \"transactions of give and take.\" \"(3) It is extremely necessary to explain beforehand the transaction of give and take outstanding between both of us. (4) Whereas two transactions have been done between you and me.\\r\\nTherefore you have agreed to stand surety.\\r\\nAnd only for that reason I am executing this agreement and giving it to you in writing and thereunder I am settling and formulating some new terms and I am confirming some very terms which were declared before.\\r\\n(5) Although in the matter of the transaction relating to the aforesaid mortgage deeds the rate of interest men tioned in the documents purporting to be the mortgage deeds is 14 annas per mensem per centum, still the actual interest is to be received only at the rate of 8 annas per mensem per centum; so it is settled between you and me and I have also agreed to the same.\\r\\nAnd even at that rate I have also been receiving the interest and I shall also receive hereafter. (6) As regards the transaction of the second mortgage deed. if as agreed at that time between you and me you pay me Rs. 1,800 in the lump then it will be understood that the transaction of give and take subsisting between you and me has been wholly completed and fully paid up.\\r\\nAs you have no sufficiency of funds to make up and pay in full the above sum at once it is settled that you are to pay to me Rs. 80 per 64 494 month and thus you are to make payment in full.\\r\\nIn accord ance with the agreement arrived at between us both subse quent to the document purporting to be the second mortgage deed the said documents and papers and the written receipts in respect of interest given to you by me relating to the payment in full made by you in respect of interest and principal on account of the first transaction dated 7 4 31 have been kept with me.\\r\\n* * (8) As mentioned above (vide paras 5 and 6) no interest of any nature whatever has remained claimable by me from you in accordance with the agreement arrived at between us both from the date of your suretyship onward and prior to it and in like manner I understand that the whole of the principal has been fully paid.\\r\\n(10) If you so wish or if necessity may arise then at any time you may ask for it and I shall give you this agree ment on being written out on stamped paper and on being registered.\\r\\n\" In our opinion, this is a document which limits and extinguishes interests in immoveable property in the present within the meaning of section 17(1) (b) of the Indian Regis tration Act.\\r\\nClause (4) of the agreement expressly says so.\\r\\nReferring to the two mortgages it says \"I am settling and formulating some new terms.\\r\\n\" This speaks from the present.\\r\\nIt does not say that this was some past agreement, and that fact is underlined in the next sentence which reads \"and I am confirming some very terms which were declared before.\\r\\n\" Among the new terms is the following.\\r\\nThe rate of inter est agreed upon in the two mortgage deeds was 14 annas per cent per month.\\r\\nClause (5) reduces this to 8 annas.\\r\\nIt is true that according to clause (5) only 8 annas had actually been paid all along but that hardly 495 matters because the question is not what was paid but what was due and what the mortgagee could have enforced under his bond.\\r\\nIt is evident from clause (4) that it was the agree ment embodied in the document which effected the change and therefore it was the document itself which brought the altered terms into being.\\r\\nThe next question is whether this limits an interest in immoveable property.\\r\\nWe are of opinion it does.\\r\\nWe agree with the learned Rangoon Judges in U. Po Thin vs Official Assignee(1) that one part of the \"interest\" which a mortga gee has in mortgaged property is the right to receive inter est at a certain rate when the document provides for inter est.\\r\\nIf that rate is varied, whether to his advantage or otherwise, then, in our judgment, his \"interest\" in the property is affected.\\r\\nIf the subsequent agreement substi tutes a higher rate, then to the extent of the difference it \"creates\" a fresh \"interest\" which was not there before.\\r\\nIf the rate is lowered, then his original \"interest\" is limited.\\r\\nThe question of a higher rate was considered by their Lordships of the Privy Council in Tika Ram vs Deputy Commis sioner of Bara Banki(2).\\r\\nThere, the mortgagors gave the mortgagees an unregistered rukka or written promise simulta neously with the registered mortgage stipulating that they would pay an extra 6 per cent per annum over and above the 15 per cent entered in the mortgage.\\r\\ntheir Lordships held that these rukkas could not be used to fetter the equity of redemption.\\r\\nThey did not decide whether the personal cove nant in the rukkas could be enforced because that point had not been raised in the plaint and pleadings, nor did they refer to the Registration Act, but we think the words \"an unregistered instrument which the statute declares is not to affect the mortgaged property\" can only have reference to that Act.\\r\\n(1) (1938) R.L.R. 293: A.I.R. 1938 R. 285.\\r\\n(2) (1899) 26 I.A. 97 at 100.\\r\\n496 It was argued, on the strength of Mahim Chandra Dey vs Ram Dayal Dutta,(1) Ram Ranjan vs Jayanti lal(2) and Collec tor of Etah vs Kishori Lal(3), that it is always open to a mortgagee to release or remit a part of the debt, and when he does so he does not limit or extinguish an interest in immovable property any more than when he passes a receipt acknowledging payment of the whole or part of the money.\\r\\nThe effect of the payment, or of the release, may be to extin guish the mortgage but in themselves they do not limit the interest.\\r\\nExtending this, the learned counsel for the defendant contended that when a mortgagee agrees to accept a lower rate of interest he does no more than release that part of the debt which would be covered by the difference in rate.\\r\\nWe do not agree.\\r\\nThere is a difference between a re ceipt and a remission or a release.\\r\\nA receipt is not the payment, nor does the document in such a case serve to extinguish the mortgage or limit the liability.\\r\\nIt is the payment of the money which does that and the receipt does no more than evidence the fact.\\r\\nNot so a release.\\r\\nThe extin guishment or diminution of liability is in that event ef fected by the agreement itself and not by something external to it.\\r\\nIf the agreement is oral, it is hit by proviso 4 to section 92 of the Evidence Act, for it \"rescinds\" or \"modi fies\" the contract of mortgage.\\r\\nIf it is in writing, it is hit by section 17 (1) (b) of the Registration Act, for in that case the writing itself \"limits\" or \"extinguishes\" the liability under the mortgage.\\r\\nIt is to be observed that when the mortgagor pays money due on the mortgage, in whole or in part, he is carrying out the terms of the bond and is not making any alteration in it, and even though the fact of payment may limit or extin guish the mortgagee \\'s interest that is only because the bond is working itself out by the force of its own terms and not by reason of some new agreement which seeks to modify it or limit or extinguish the interest which it creates.\\r\\nA simple test (1)A.I.R. (3) A.I.R. 1930 All. 721 at 725 F.B. (2) A.I.R. 1926 Cal. 906.\\r\\n497 is this: see whether the mortgagee can, in the face of the subsequent agreement, enforce the terms of his bond.\\r\\nIf he cannot, then it is plain that the subsequent undertaking has effected a modification, and if that has the effect of limiting or extinguishing the mortgagee \\'s interest, it is at once hit either by section 17 (1) (b) or section 92 proviso 4.\\r\\nBut when there is a mere payment of money, that is done under the terms of the bond, for the contract of mortgage postulates that the mortgagor should repay the money bor rowed and that when he does so the mortgagee \\'s interest in the property shall be \"limited\" to the extent of the repay ment or, when all is repaid, be wholly extinguished; nor, of course, does a payment have to be made by a written or registered instrument, or even evidenced by one.\\r\\nClause (xi) to section 17 (2) of the Registration Act is based on this principle.\\r\\nIt draws a distinction between a document which, by the force of its terms.\\r\\neffects the extinguishment, or purports to do so, and one which merely evidences an exter nal fact which brings about that result.\\r\\nNow apply the test just given to the present case.\\r\\nUnder the mortgages the mortgagee is entitled to interest at 14 annas per cent.\\r\\nper month but the mortgagor says he cannot claim that.\\r\\nWhy ? Because, according to him, the subsequent agreement altered the terms of the bond and reduced his liability to only 8 annas.\\r\\nIt hardly matters what the agreement is called, whether a release or a remission, nor is it germane to the question that the mortgagee is enti tled to remit or release the whole or a part of the debt; the fact remains that his agreement to do so effects an alteration in the original contract and by the force of its terms or extinguishes his interest, Assume that the mortga gor repaid the whole of the interest at the altered rate and the whole of the principaL, would those repayments by them selves effect an extinguishment of the mortgage ? Clearly not, because unless the subsequent agreement is called in aid, more would be due under the terms of the bond on ac count of the higher rate of interest.\\r\\nIt is evident then that it is the 498 agreement which limits the mortgagee \\'s interest \\' and serves to extinguish the mortgage and not mere payment at the reduced rate.\\r\\nSimilar observations apply to clause (6) of the agree ment.\\r\\nIt begins by reciting a past agreement in which the mortgagor had promised to pay Rs. 1,800 in a lump sum.\\r\\nWe are left to infer that this was to extinguish the mortgage.\\r\\nIf it was, then it would be hit by either section 92, provi so 4, of the Evidence Act or section 17(1)(b) of the Regis tration Act, but that does not matter because the present document varies even that agreement and substitutes a third agreement in its place, namely that payment of Rs. 1,800 by instalments at the rate of Rs 80 a month will effect \"pay ment in full\", that is to say, will extinguish the mortgage.\\r\\nThis speaks from the date of the document, for it says, referring to this agreement, that \\' it is settled\" etc.\\r\\nNext we come to clause (8).\\r\\nThat refers us back to clauses (5) and (6) and says that \"as mentioned there no interest of any nature whatever has remained claimable by me\" and speaking of the principal says \"and in like manner I understand the whole of the prin cipal has been fully paid\".\\r\\nWe have already dealt with clauses (5) and (6).\\r\\nClause (8) carries us no further and merely states that because of clauses (5) and (6) neither interest nor principal is now claimable; and of course if neither interest nor principal is claimable that extinguish es the mortgage, and in this case the extinguishment is brought about, not by mere payment in accordance with the terms of the bond, but because of the fresh agreement.\\r\\nClause (10) remains for consideration.\\r\\nIt was argued that this brings the matter within section 17(2) (v) of the Registration Act because it gives the defendant the right to obtain another document which will effect the extinguish ment.\\r\\nWe do not agree because clause (v) of sub section (2) of section 17 of the Act postulates that the document shall not of itself create, declare, 499 assign, limit, extinguish any right etc., and that it shall merely create a right to obtain another document etc.\\r\\n(The stress is on the words \"itself\" and \"merely \". ) We agree with Sir Dinsha Mulla at page 86 of the 5th edition of his Indian Registration Act that \"If the document itself creates an interest in immove able property, the fact that it contemplates the execution of another document will not exempt it from registration under this clause.\\r\\n\" As we have seen, this document of itself limits or extinguishes certain interests in the mortgaged property),.\\r\\nThe operative words are reasonably clear.\\r\\nConsequently, the document is not one which merely confers a right to obtain another document.\\r\\nIt confers the right only in certain contingencies, namely, \"if you so wish\" or \"if necessity may arise.\\r\\n\" Its purport is to effect an immediate alteration in the terms of the two bonds and because of that alteration to effect an immediate extinguishment and limitation.\\r\\nClause (10) merely confers an additional right, namely the right to obtain another document \"if you so wish\" or \"if necessity may arise.\" Therefore, the document in question is not one which merely creates a right to obtain another.\\r\\nAn agreement to sell, or an agreement to transfer at some future date, is to be distinguished because that sort of document does not of itself purport to effect the trans fer.\\r\\nIt merely embodies a present agreement to execute another document in the future which will, when executed, have that effect.\\r\\nThe document in hand is not of that type.\\r\\nIt does not postpone the effect of extinguishment or limita tion of the mortgages to a future date.\\r\\nIt does not say that the agreement it embodies shall take effect in the future.\\r\\nIt purports to limit and extinguish the liabilities on the two mortgages at once by virtue of the document itself and merely adds that \"if it is necessary or should you want another document, I will repeat the present 500 agreement in a registered agreement.\\r\\n\" By implication it means that if it is not necessary, or if the mortgagor does not want a registered instrument, the document itself will have effect.\\r\\nIncidentally, one effect of holding that this document does not limit or extinguish the mortgagor \\'s li ability would be that there is no agreement to that effect yet in force, This may or may not give the mortgagor a right to obtain specific performance of his right to obtain such an agreement but until he does that there would be no bar to the mortgagee \\'s claim in this suit.\\r\\nHowever, it is not necessary to go as far as that because we are of opinion that this document is not exempt from registration under section 17(2) (v), and we so hold.\\r\\nThe next question is whether the document can be used in evidence under the proviso to section 49 of the Registration Act.\\r\\nWe are clear it cannot.\\r\\nThis is not a suit for specif ic performance nor does any question of part performance under section 53A of the Transfer of Property Act arise.\\r\\nIt remains then to be seen whether the use now sought to be made of the document is to evidence a collateral transaction not required to be evidenced by a registered instrument.\\r\\nBut what is the \\'transaction sought to be proved but the very agreement which the document not merely evidences but, by reason of its own force, creates ? That is not a collat eral transaction and even if it were a transaction of that type, it would require a registered instrument for the reasons we have already given.\\r\\nSection 53A of the Transfer of Property Act was re ferred to but it has no application, for the agreement we are concerned with is not a transfer.\\r\\nThere are no words of conveyance in it; also the mortgagor is not continuing in possession in part performance of the contract.\\r\\nBoth mort gages were simple and the right to possession never resided in the mortgagee.\\r\\nHe might in due course have acquired it by process of law if he obtained a decree and purchased at the sale; on the other hand, a stranger might have purchased and the right to possession would \\'in that event have passed elsewhere, But he had no right to possession at the 501 date of the agreement and having none he could not have transferred it.\\r\\nThe mortgagor \\'s possession was consequently not referable to the agreement.\\r\\nThe appeal fails and is dismissed with costs.\\r\\nAppeal dismissed.\\r\\n', {'entities': [[0, 29, 'CASE_NUMBER'], [71, 92, 'DATE'], [101, 125, 'COURT'], [129, 135, 'GPE'], [137, 157, 'JUDGE'], [162, 183, 'CASE_NUMBER'], [212, 231, 'DATE'], [240, 282, 'COURT'], [286, 291, 'GPE'], [295, 322, 'CASE_NUMBER'], [324, 351, 'LAWYER'], [372, 385, 'LAWYER'], [407, 419, 'DATE'], [465, 472, 'JUDGE'], [563, 581, 'DATE'], [642, 664, 'DATE'], [740, 745, 'OTHERS'], [766, 772, 'OTHERS'], [866, 877, 'OTHERS'], [946, 965, 'DATE'], [1190, 1211, 'DATE'], [1785, 1788, 'OTHERS'], [2033, 2039, 'GPE'], [2117, 2124, 'OTHERS'], [3444, 3453, 'OTHERS'], [3732, 3738, 'OTHERS'], [3743, 3749, 'OTHERS'], [4825, 4842, 'PROVISION'], [4850, 4875, 'STATUTE'], [5358, 5368, 'PROVISION'], [5424, 5434, 'PROVISION'], [5497, 5500, 'OTHERS'], [5647, 5657, 'PROVISION'], [5975, 6006, 'PRECEDENT'], [6618, 6666, 'PRECEDENT'], [7188, 7204, 'STATUTE'], [7386, 7405, 'PRECEDENT'], [7476, 7512, 'PRECEDENT'], [7517, 7545, 'PRECEDENT'], [7550, 7586, 'PRECEDENT'], [7841, 7847, 'OTHERS'], [8734, 8744, 'PROVISION'], [8752, 8764, 'STATUTE'], [8860, 8878, 'PROVISION'], [8886, 8903, 'STATUTE'], [9487, 9497, 'PRECEDENT'], [9498, 9509, 'PRECEDENT'], [9535, 9561, 'PRECEDENT'], [9878, 9896, 'PROVISION'], [9900, 9921, 'PROVISION'], [10394, 10408, 'PROVISION'], [10416, 10432, 'STATUTE'], [11900, 11910, 'PROVISION'], [12017, 12022, 'OTHERS'], [12145, 12155, 'PROVISION'], [12176, 12188, 'STATUTE'], [12192, 12208, 'PROVISION'], [12216, 12233, 'STATUTE'], [12391, 12396, 'OTHERS'], [12649, 12658, 'PROVISION'], [12685, 12704, 'PROVISION'], [12950, 12968, 'PROVISION'], [12972, 12982, 'PROVISION'], [13039, 13058, 'PROVISION'], [13355, 13365, 'PROVISION'], [13444, 13461, 'PROVISION'], [13469, 13485, 'STATUTE'], [13618, 13628, 'PROVISION'], [13632, 13661, 'PROVISION'], [13739, 13742, 'OTHERS'], [13926, 13942, 'OTHERS'], [13980, 14003, 'STATUTE'], [14725, 14736, 'PROVISION'], [16416, 16433, 'PROVISION'], [16539, 16549, 'PROVISION'], [16557, 16574, 'STATUTE'], [16694, 16705, 'PROVISION'], [16725, 16737, 'STATUTE'], [17247, 17258, 'PROVISION'], [17266, 17290, 'STATUTE'], [17886, 17889, 'OTHERS']]}]\n",

Kapur, with him) for the appellant.\\r\\nB. Sen for the respondents.\\r\\nAlladi Krishnaswami Aiyar (Jindra Lal, with him) for the Union of India. 1950.\\r\\nMay 26.\\r\\nThe Court delivered judgment as follows : KANIA C.J I have read the judgments prepared by Messrs. Fazl Ali, Mahajan and Mukherjea JJ.\\r\\n461 in this case.\\r\\nAs the views in those judgments in respect of the nature of the duties and functions of the Industrial Tribunal do not show agreement I consider it necessary to add a few words of my own.\\r\\nIn my opinion, the functions and duties of the Indus trial Tribunal are very much like those of a body discharg ing judicial functions, although it is not a Court.\\r\\nThe rules framed by the Tribunal require evidence to be taken and witnesses to be examined, cross examined and re exam ined.\\r\\nThe Act constituting the Tribunal imposes penalties for incorrect statements made before the Tribunal.\\r\\nWhile the powers of the Industrial Tribunal in some respects are different from those of an ordinary civil Court and it has jurisdiction and powers to give reliefs which a civil Court administering the law of the land (for instance, \\'ordering the reinstatement of a workman) does not possess in the discharge of its duties it is essentially working as a judicial body.\\r\\nThe fact that its determination has to be followed by an order of the Government which makes the award binding, or that in cases where Government is a party the legislature is permitted to revise the decision, or that the Government is empowered to fix the period.\\r\\nof the opera tion of the award do not, to my mind, alter the nature and character of the functions of the Tribunal.\\r\\nHaving consid ered all the provisions of the Act it seems to me clear that the Tribunal is discharging functions very near those of a Court, although it is not a Court in the technical sense of the word.\\r\\nThe next question is whether under article 136 the Court has jurisdiction to entertain an application for leave to appeal against the decision of such a body.\\r\\nIt is not dis puted that the Court has power to issue writs of certiorari and prohibition in respect of the work of the Tribunal.\\r\\nThe only question is whether there is a right of appeal also.\\r\\nIn my opinion the wording of article 136 is wide enough to give jurisdiction to the Court to entertain an application for leave to appeal, although it is obvious that having regard to the nature of the functions of the Tribu nal, this Court will be very reluctant to entertain such an application.\\r\\n462 As regards the merits, I do not think this is a case in which I would admit the appeal.\\r\\nThe aggrieved parties may apply for redress by adopting other appropriate proceedings.\\r\\nThe appeal therefore should be dismissed with costs.\\r\\nFAZL ALl J.\\r\\nThe important question to be decided in this case is whether the present appeal lies at all to this Court.\\r\\nThe question is not free from difficulty, but on the whole I am inclined to think that \\'the appeal does lie.\\r\\nIt is fully recognized that the scope article 136 of the Constitution is very wide, but the significance of the language used in the section can be appreciated only by comparing it with the articles which precede it.\\r\\nArticle 132 deals with the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court in cases involving a substantial question of law as to the interpretation of the Constitution, and the words used in that article are: \"appeal. from any judgment, decree or finalorder.\" Article 133 deals with appeals in civil matters and the same words are used here also.\\r\\nArti cle 134 deals with appeals in criminal matters, and the words used in it are: \"appeal. from any judgment, final order or sentence.\" In article 136, the words \"judg ment\" and \"decree,\" which are used in articles 132 and 133 are retained.\\r\\nSimilarly, the words \"judgment\" and \"sen tence\" occurring in article 134 are also retained.\\r\\nBut the expression \"final order\" becomes \"order,\" and, instead of the High Court, reference is made to \"any court.\\r\\n\" Cer tain other words are also used in the article which seem to me to have a special significance, these being \"determina tion,\" \"cause or matter\" and \"tribunal.\\r\\n\" It is obvious that these words greatly widen the scope of article 136.\\r\\nThey show that an appeal will lie also from a determination or order of \"any tribunal\" in any cause or matter.\\r\\nCan we then say that an Industrial Tribunal does not fall within the scope of article 136 ? If we go by a mere label, the answer must be in the affirmative.\\r\\nBut we have to look further and see what are the main functions of the Tribunal and how it proceeds to discharge those functions.\\r\\nThis is necessary because 463 I take it to be implied that before an appeal can.\\r\\nlie to this Court from a tribunal it must perform some kind of judicial function and partake to some extent of the charac ter of a Court.\\r\\nNow there can be no doubt that the Industrial Tribunal has, to use a well known expression, \"all the trappings of a Court\" and performs functions which cannot but be regarded as judicial.\\r\\nThis is evident from the rules by which the proceedings before the Tribunal are regulated.\\r\\nIt appears that the proceeding before it commences on an application which in many respects is in the nature of a plaint.\\r\\nIt has the same powers as are vested in a civil Court under the Code of Civil Procedure when trying a suit, in respect of discovery, inspection, granting adjournment, reception of evidence taken on affidavit, enforcing the attendance witnesses, compelling the production of documents, issuing commissions, etc.\\r\\nIt is to be deemed to be a civil Court within the meaning of sections 480 and 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code, 1898.\\r\\nIt may admit and call for evidence at any stage of the proceeding and has the power to administer oaths.\\r\\nThe parties appearing before it have the right of examination, cross examination and re examination and of addressing it after all evidence has been called.\\r\\nA party may also be represented by a. legal practitioner with its permission.\\r\\nThe matter does not rest there.\\r\\nThe main function of this Tribunal is to adjudicate on industrial disputes which implies that there must be two or more parties before it with conflicting cases, and that it has also to arrive at a conclusion as to how the dispute is to be ended.\\r\\nPrima facie, therefore, a Tribunal like this cannot be excluded from the scope of article 136, but before any final conclu sion can be expressed on the subject certain contentions which have been put forward on behalf of the respondents have to be disposed of.\\r\\nThe first contention is that the Industrial Tribunal cannot be said to perform a judicial or quasi judicial function.\\r\\nsince it is not required to be guided by any recognized substantive law in deciding disputes 464 which come before it.\\r\\nOn the other hand, in deciding industrial disputes, it has to override contracts and create rights which are opposed to contractual rights.\\r\\nIn these circumstances, it is said that the very questions which arose before the Privy Council in Moses vs\\r\\nParker Ex parte Mose (1) arise in this case, these questions being : (1) How can the propriety of the Tribunal \\'s decision be tested on appeal, and (2) What are the canons by which the appellate Court is to be guided in deciding the appeal ? Their Lordships of the Privy Council undoubtedly felt that these were serious questions, but they had no hesitation in saying that \"if it were clear that appeals ought to be allowed.\\r\\nsuch difficulties would doubtless be met somehow.\\r\\n\" This, in my opinion, is a sufficient answer to the difficul ty raised.\\r\\nThe Tribunal has to adjudicate in accordance with the provisions of the .\\r\\nIt may sometimes override contracts, but so can a Court which has to administer law according to the Bengal or Bihar Money lenders Act, Encumbered Estates Act and other similar Acts.\\r\\nThe Tribunal has to observe the provisions of the special law which it has to administer though that law may be dif ferent from the law which an ordinary Court of justice administers.\\r\\nThe appellate Court, therefore, can at least see that the rules according to which it has to act and the provisions which are binding upon it are observed, and its powers are not.exercised in an arbitrary or capricious manner.\\r\\nThe second contention, which is a more serious one, is that the adjudication of the Tribunal has not all the at tributes of a judicial decision, because the adjudication cannot bind the parties until it is declared to be binding by the Government under section 15 of the Industrial Dis putes Act.\\r\\nIt is said that the adjudication is really in the nature of an advice or report which is not effective until made so by the Government.\\r\\nIt appears that a similar objection was raised in Rex vs Electricity Commissioner \\'s, London Electricily \\' (1) Joint Committee Co. (1920) Ex Parte (1) for the purpose of deciding whether a writ of certiorari should be Issued in the circumstances of the case but was dis.\\r\\nposed of in these words : \"It is necessary, however, to deal with what i think was the main objection of the Attorney General.\\r\\nIn this case he said the Commissioners come to no decision at all.\\r\\nThey act merely as advisers.\\r\\nThey recommend an order embodying a scheme to the Minister of Transport, who may confirm it with or without nodifications.\\r\\nSimilarly the Minister of Trans port comes to no decision.\\r\\nHe submits the order to the Houses of Parliament, who may approve it with or without modifications.\\r\\nThe Houses of Parliament may put anything into the order they please, whether consistent with the Act of 1919, or not.\\r\\nUntil they have approved, nothing is decided, and in truth the whole procedure, draft scheme, inquiry, order, confirmation, approval, is only part of a process by which Parliament is expressing its will, and at no stage is subject to any control by the Courts.\\r\\nIt is unnecessary to emphasize the constitutional importance of this contention. .\\r\\nIn the provision that the final decision of the Commissioners is not to be operative until it has been approved by the two Houses of Parliament I find nothing inconsistent with the view that in arriving at that decision the Commissioners themselves are to act judicially and within the limits prescribed by Act of Parliament, and that the Courts have power to keep them within those limits.\\r\\nIt is to be noted that it is the order of the Commissioners that eventually takes effect; neither the Minister of Trans port who confirms, nor the Houses of Parliament who approve, can under the statute make an order which in respect.\\r\\nof the matters in question has any operation.\\r\\nI know of no author ity which compels me to hold that a proceeding cannot be a judicial proceeding subject to prohibition or certiorari because it is subject to confirmation or approval, even where the approval has to be that of the Houses of Parlia ment.\\r\\nThe authorities are to the contrary. \\' \\' (1) 466 It is well known that a writ of certiorari can issue only against an order of a judicial or quasi judicial tribu nal and if it is permissible for the High Court to.\\r\\nissue a writ of certiorari against an Industrial Tribunal, which fact was not seriously disputed before us, I find it diffi cult to hold that the tribunal does not come with in the purview of article 136.\\r\\nIf a subordinate Court acts in excess of its jurisdiction or assumes a jurisdiction which it does not possess, the appellate Court can always interfere and do what is contemplated to be done by a writ of certiorari.\\r\\nIt is to be noted that under section 15 of the , in cases where the appropriate Govern ment is not a party to the dispute, all that the Government has to do on receiving the award of the Tribunal is to declare it to be binding and to state from what date and for what period it will be binding.\\r\\nSection 15.(2) is mandatory and it provides: \"On receipt of such award, the appropriate Government shall by order in writing declare the award to be binding. . \" Thus the Government cannot alter, or cancel, or add to the award, but the award must be declared to be binding as it is.\\r\\nIn substance, therefore, the adjudication of the Tribunal amounts to a final determination of the dispute which binds the parties as well as the Government.\\r\\nOur attention was however drawn to the proviso to section 15 (2), which runs as follows: \"Provided that where the appropriate Government is a. party to the dispute and in its opinion it would be inexpe dient on public grounds to give effect to the whole or any part of the award, it shall on the first available opportu nity lay the award together with the statement of its rea sons for not making a declaration as aforesaid before the Legislative Assembly of the Province, or where the appropri ate Government is the Central Government, before the Central Legislative Assembly, and shall, as soon as may be, cause to be moved therein a resolution for the consideration of the 467 award, and the Legislative Assembly may, by its resolution, confirm, modify, or reject the award.\\r\\n\" This proviso was relied upon by the respondents to show that the right to appeal from the award could not have been contemplated in any case.\\r\\nBut the Act itself makes a dis tinction between cases in which the Government is a party and those in which the Government is not a party.\\r\\nThe proviso relates to a very special type of case and as at present advised I do not wish to express any opinion as to whether an appeal lies to this Court or not in such a case, but, in my judgment, where the Government has only to de clare the award to be binding, an appeal shall lie.\\r\\nIt is necessary here to say a few words as to the scope of the appeal.\\r\\nAs was pointed out by this Court in Pritam Singh vs The State(1), the power under article 136 of the Constitution being a special power is to be exercised only in special cases.\\r\\nThe rule so laid down is bound to re strict the scope of the appeal in practice in almost all the cases which fall under article 136.\\r\\nBut in some cases a limitation will be imposed on the scope of the appeal by the very nature of the case and of the tribunal from which an appeal is sought to be brought, and a case under the Indus trial Disputes Act seems to be an example of such a case.\\r\\nDealing now with the merits of the appeal, I am not prepared to hold that this is a proper case for interference with the adjudication of the Tribunal.\\r\\nThe power of this Court was invoked by the appellants on four grounds.\\r\\nThese grounds have been elaborately examined by Mahajan J. and two of them have been pronounced to be wholly inadequate for justifying our interference.\\r\\nMy view with regard to these two grounds is identical with that of Mahajan J. and I do not wish to add to what he has already said on the subject.\\r\\nThe remaining two grounds also are, in my opinion, wholly insufficient to justify the exercise of our special power under article 136.\\r\\nOne of these grounds is that the award of the Tribunal is based on no evidence whatsoever.\\r\\nI do not, however, find that this ground (1) ; 60 468 was urged in this form in the application for special leave to appeal to this Court.\\r\\nAll that was intended to be urged was that the appellants wanted to adduce evidence but were not allowed to do so.\\r\\nFrom the decision of the Tribunal however, it appears that the evidence that was shut out related to one isolated point only and the Tribunal might well have been justified in not allowing evidence to be admitted on a point which in its opinion had no direct bearing on the issue before them.\\r\\nAfter hearing the re spondents on this particular point, I am not disposed to hold that the Tribunal has committed such an error as would justify the interference of this Court.\\r\\nThe last ground urged is that the award has been signed by only two members of the Tribunal though it originally consisted of three persons and though the entire hearing of the dispute had taken place before all the three persons.\\r\\nThis objection does not appear to me to be fatal to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal, because under section 8 of the Act it is not obligatory on the Government to appoint a new member to fill a vacancy if one of the members ceases to be available at any time during the proceedings.\\r\\nUnder that section, if the Chairman ceases to be available, the Govern ment must appoint his successor, whereas if a member ceases to be available the Government may or may not appoint any one to fill his place.\\r\\nIn the present case, our attention was drawn to some correspondence which shows that one of the members was called upon to act as a member of another Tribu nal and the award in question was pronounced after informing the Government of the procedure which the Chairman and the remaining members intended to adopt.\\r\\nIn the view I have taken, this appeal must fail, and I would accordingly dismiss it with costs.\\r\\nMAHAJAN J. This is an appeal by special leave from the determination of an industrial dispute by the Industrial Tribunal appointed under Ordinance VI of 1949.\\r\\nBharat Bank Limited, Delhi, the appellant, is a company registered under the Indian Companies Act.\\r\\n469 Its employees made certain demands and as a result of an unfavourable response from the bank it appears that they struck work on the 9th March, 1949.\\r\\nThe bank in its turn served notices on them to resume work and proceeded to discharge a number of them between the 19th March and 24th March as they failed to do so.\\r\\nThe Central Government constitued a Tribunal consisting of three persons for the adjudication of industrial disputes in banking companies under section 7 of the (XIV of 1947), The disputes mentioned in schedule II of the notifi cation were referred under section 10 of the Act to this Tribunal.\\r\\nItem 18 of this schedule reads as follows : \"Retrenchment and victimization (Specific cases to be cited by employees).\\r\\n\" The dispute under this item between the Bharat Bank and its employees was heard by the Tribunal at Delhi and its award was made on the 19th January, 1950.\\r\\nIt was published in the Government of India Gazette dated 4th February, 1950, and was declared to be binding for a period of one year.\\r\\nThe award of the Tribunal was signed by two out of its three members.\\r\\nA preliminary objection was raised on behalf of the Central Government as well as on behalf of the respondents that this Court had no jurisdiction to grant special leave to appeal against the determination of an Industrial Tribu nal inasmuch as it did not exercise the judicial powers of the State and that its determination was not in the nature of a judgment, decree or order of a Court so as to be ap pealable.\\r\\nThis being the first case in which special leave was granted from the determination of an Industrial Tribu nal, it is necessary to examine the provisions of the Con stitution dealing with this matter and if possible, to define the limits of the jurisdiction of this Court under article 136.\\r\\nThis article is in these terms : \"(1) Notwithstanding anything in this Chapter, the Supreme Court may, in its discretion, grant special leave to appeal from any judgment, decree, determination, sentence or order m any cause or matter passed 470 or made by any court or tribunal in the territory of India.\\r\\n(2) Nothing in clause (1) shall apply to any judgment, determination, sentence or order passed or made by any court or tribunal constituted by or under any law relating to the Armed Forces.\\r\\n\" The article occurs in Chapter IV of Part V of the Consti tution: \"The Union Judiciary.\\r\\n\" Article deals with the establishment and constitution of the Supreme Court.\\r\\nArticle 131 confers original jurisdiction on this Court in certain disputes arising between the Government of India and the States etc.\\r\\nArticles and 133 deal with the appellate juris diction of the Court in appeals from High Courts within the territory of India in civil matters.\\r\\nBy article 134 limited right of appeal in criminal cases has been allowed.\\r\\nThe Judicial Committee of the Privy Council which was the high est Court of appeal for India prior to 10th October, 1949, was not a Court of criminal appeal in the sense in which this Court has been made a Court of criminal appeal under article 134.\\r\\nIt could only entertain appeals on the crimi nal side in exercise of the prerogative of the King.\\r\\nArticle 135 empowers this Court to hear all appeals which under existing laws could be heard by the Federal Court of India.\\r\\nBy the Abolition of Privy Council Jurisdiction Act, 1949,which came into force on the 10th October, 1949, all the powers that were possessed by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in regard to cases or matters arising in India became exercisable by the Federal Court of India whether those powers were exercisable by reason of statutory authority or under the prerogative of the King.\\r\\nThe powers of the Judicial Committee were conferred upon it by the Judicial Committee Act, 1844 (7 & 8 Vict., C. 69).\\r\\nAppeals lay to His Majesty in Council from judgments, sentences, decreesor orders of any Court of justice within any British colony or possession abroad.\\r\\nClosely following article 135 which confers all the powers of the Judicial Committee on the Supreme Court comes article 136.\\r\\nThe language employed in this article is very wide and is of a comprehensive character.\\r\\nPowers given 471 are of an overriding nature.\\r\\nThe article commences with the words \"Notwithstanding anything in this Chapter.\\r\\n\" These words indicate that the intention of the Constitution was to disregard in extraordinary cases the limitations contained in the previous articles on this Court \\'s power to entertain appeals.\\r\\nThese articles dealt with the right of appeal against final decisions of High Courts within the territory of India.\\r\\nArticle 136, however, overrides that qualification and empowers this Court to grant special leave even in cases where the judgment has not been given by a High Court but has been given by any Court in the territory of India; in other words, it contemplates grant of special leave in cases where a Court subordinate to a High Court has passed or made any order and the situation demands that the order should be quashed or reversed even without having recourse to the usual procedure provided by law in the nature of an appeal, etc.\\r\\nThe word \"order\" in article 136 has not been qualified by the word \"final.\\r\\n\" It is clear, therefore, that the power to grant special leave under this article against an order of a Court could be exercised with respect to interlocutory orders also.\\r\\nAnother new feature introduced in article 136 is the power given to grant special leave against orders, and determinations etc.\\r\\nof any tribunal in the territory of India.\\r\\nThis word did not find place in the Judicial Committee Act, where the phrase used was \"a Court of jus tice.\\r\\n\" It is the introduction of this new expression in article 136 that has led to considerable argument as to its scope.\\r\\nAnother expression that did not find place in the Judicial Committee Act but has been introduced in article 136 is the word \"determination.\" A question has been raised as to the meaning to be given to these words in the article.\\r\\nOn the one hand, it was contended that the words \"determina tion\" and \"tribunal\" were introduced in the article in order to bring within the scope of the applellate jurisdiction of this Court all orders of tribunals of different varieties and descriptions.\\r\\nOn the other hand, it was said that the words \"determination\" and \"tribunal\" were added in the article by way of abundant caution and 472 the intention was that if a tribunal exercised the judicial powers of the State and the decision was passed in the exercise of that power, this Court as the highest judicial Court in the Republic would have power, if it considered, necessary in the ends of justice, to grant special leave.\\r\\nClause (2) of article 136 excludes the jurisdiction of this Court in respect of military Courts.\\r\\nor Tribunal.\\r\\nIt is interesting to observe that in articles 138, 139 and 140 the Constitution has conferred powers on Parliament for further enlargement of the powers of this Court.\\r\\nTwo points arise for determination in this case: (1) whether the word \"tribunal\" in this article has been used in the same sense as \"Court,\" or whether it has been used in a wider sense, and (2) whether the word \"determination\" in the article includes within its scope the determinations made by Industrial Tribunals or other similarly constituted bodies or whether it has reference only to determinations of a Court or a tribunal of a purely judicial character.\\r\\nIt was conceded by the learned counsel appearing for the Cen tral Government, Mr. Alladi Krishnaswami Aiyar, that if any tribunal, whether administrative, domestic or quasi judi cial, acts in excess of its jurisdiction, then it can be controlled by the High Courts under the powers conferred on them by article 226 by the issue of a writ of certiorari.\\r\\nIt was said that if the Industrial Tribunal in this case could be proved to have trespassed beyond the limits 0 its statutory jurisdiction, then the remedy lies elsewhere and not by a petition of special leave under article 136.\\r\\nMr. Alladi \\'s contentions may be briefly summarized as follows: (1) The expression \"tribunal \" means seat of a judge, or a court of justice.\\r\\nIts necessary attribute is that it can give a final judgment between two parties which carries legal sanction by its own force.\\r\\nThat the word \"tribunal\" in juxtaposition to the word \"court\" could only mean a tribunal \\'which exercised judicial functions of the State and did not include within its ambit a tribunal which had quasi judicial or administrative powers.\\r\\n(2) The kinds of orders against which special leave to appeal could be given under article 136 473 have to be of the same nature as passed by a Court , \\' in other words, it was said that unless there was a judicial determination of a controversy between two parties, the order would not be appealable.\\r\\nThat in the case of an Industrial Tribunal what gives binding force to the award is the declaration of the government, that the spark of life to it is given by that declaration and without that, the award of the Tribunal is lifeless and has no enforceability and hence cannot be held to be of an appealable nature.\\r\\nIt was further said that in cases between the Government and its employees, by the procedure prescribed in the Act the award could also be rejected, and that being so, by its own deter mination a tribunal could not impose a liability or affect rights.\\r\\nDr. Bakshi Tek Chand, appearing for the bank, on the other hand argued that whenever a tribunal, whether exercis ing judicial or quasi judicial functions, determined a matter in a judicial manner, then such a determination is within article 136.\\r\\nIt was said that an Industrial Tribunal has no administrative or executive functions, that its duty is to adjudicate on an industrial dispute, i.e., to act as a Judge, on certain kinds of disputes between employers and employees and that its functions are of a judicial nature, though the ambit of the powers conferred is larger than that of an ordinary Court of law inasmuch as it can grant reliefs which no Court of law could give, but that is because of the powers conferred on it by law.\\r\\nIt was argued that the plain words of the article should not be given a narrow meaning when the intention of the Constitution was to confer the widest power on this Court.\\r\\nIt was further contended that as between private employers and employees and even in certain cases between Government and its employees the decision of the Tribunal was binding on the Government and Government had no power either to affirm, modify or reject it.\\r\\nAll that it was authorised to do was to announce it and by its declaration give it enforceability; that fact, howev er, could not affect the question of appealability of the determination under article 136.\\r\\nIt was finally argued that powers should be exercised by this Court wherever there is a miscarriage 474 of justice by a determination of any tribunal and that if the intention of the Constitution by use of the word \"tribunal\"was in the same sense as \"court,\" then it was not necessary to import it in article 136, because all tribunals that exercise judicial functions fall within the definition of the word \"court\" though they may not have been so de scribed.\\r\\nAfter considerable thought I have reached the conclusion that the preliminary objection should be overruled.\\r\\nI see no cogent reasons to limit the plain words of the statute and to place a narrow interpretation on words of widest ampli tude used therein.\\r\\nIn construing the articles of the Con stitution it has always to be remembered that India has been constituted into a sovereign democratic republic in order to ensure justice to all its citizens.\\r\\nIn other words, the foundations of this republic have been laid on the bedrock of justice.\\r\\nTo safeguard these foundations so that they may not be undermined by injustice occurring anywhere this Court has been constituted.\\r\\nBy article S2 of the Constitu tion the Court is empowered to see that the fundamental rights conferred on the citizens by the Constitution are not in any way affected.\\r\\nBy article 136 it has been given overriding power to grant special leave to appeal against orders of courts and tribunals which go against the princi ple of natural justice and lead to grave miscarriage of justice.\\r\\nThe exercise of these, powers could only have been contemplated in cases which affect the rights of people living within the territory of India in respect of their person, property or status.\\r\\nThe question, therefore, for consideration is whether the jurisdiction conferred by use of unambiguous phraseology and by words which have a plain grammatical meaning and are of the widest amplitudeshould be limited and restricted on considerations suggested by Mr. Alladi.\\r\\nThe construction suggested by the learned counsel, if accepted, would in the first instance make the use of certain words in the article unnecessary and redundant and would run counter to the spirit of the Constitution.\\r\\nIt must be presumed that the draftsmen of the Constitution knew well the fact that there were a number of tribunals consti tuted in this country 475 previous to the coming into force of the Constitution which were performing certain administrative, quasi judicial or domestic functions, that some of them had even the trap pings of a Court but in spite of those trappings could not be given that description.\\r\\nIt must also be presumed that the Constitution makers were aware of the fact that the highest Courts in this country had held that all tribunals that discharged judicial functions fell within the definition of the expression \"Court.\\r\\n\" If by the use of the word \"tribu nal\" in article 136 the intention was to give it the same meaning as \"Court,\" then it was redundant and unnecessary to import it in the article because, by whatever name de scribed, such a tribunal would fall within the definition of the word \"Court.\\r\\n\" The word \"Court\" has a well known meaning in legislative history and practice.\\r\\nAs pointed out in Halsbury \\'s Laws of England, the word \"Court\" originally meant the King \\'s Palace but subsequently acquired the meaning of (1) a place where justice was admin istered, and (2) the person or persons who administer it.\\r\\nIn the Indian Evidence Act it is defined as including all judges and magistrates and all persons except arbitrators legally authorized to take evidence.\\r\\nThis definition is by no means exhaustive and has been framed only for the pur poses of the Act.\\r\\nThere can be no doubt that to be a Court, the person or persons who constitute it must be entrusted with judicial functions, that is, of deciding litigated questions according to law.\\r\\nHowever, by agreement between parties arbitrators may be called upon to exercise judicial powers and to decide a dispute according to law but that would not make the arbitrators a Court.\\r\\nIt appears to me that before a person or persons can be said to constitute a Court it must be held that they derive their powers from the State and are exercising the judicial powers of the State.\\r\\nIn R.v.\\r\\nLondon County Council (1), Saville L.J. gave the following meaning to the word \"Court\" or \"judicial authori ty\" : (1) [1931]2K.B. 215.\\r\\n61 476 \"It is not necessary that it should be a Court in the sense that this Court is a Court, it is enough if it is exercising, after hearing evidence, judicial functions in the sense that it has to decide on evidence between a proposal and an opposition; and it is not necessary to be strictly a Court if it is a tribuna which has to decide rightly after hearing evidence and opposition.\\r\\n\" As pointed out in picturesque language by Lord Sankey L.C. in Shell Co. of Australia vs Federal Commissioner of Taxation(1), there are tribunals with many of the trappings of a Court which, nevertheless, are not Courts in the strict sense of exercising judicial power.\\r\\nIt seems to me that such tribunals though they are not full fledged Courts, yet exercise quasi judicial functions and are within the ambit of the word \"tribunal\" in article 136 of the Constitution.\\r\\nIt was pointed out in the above case that a tribunal is not necessarily a Court in this strict sense because it gives a final decision, nor because it hears witnesses oath nor because two or more contending parties appear before it between whom it has to decide, nor because it gives deci sions which affect the rights of subjects nor because there is an appeal to a Court, nor because it is a body to which a matter is referred by another body.\\r\\nThe intention of the Constitution by use of the word \"tribunal\" in the article seems to have been to include within the scope of article 136 tribunals adorned with similar trappings as Court but strictly not coming within that definition.\\r\\nVarious defi nitions of the phrase \"judicial power\" have been given from time to time.\\r\\nThe best definition of it on high authority is the one given by Griffith C.J. in Huddart, Parker & Co. vs Moorehead(2), wherein it is defined as follows : \"The words \\'judicial power \\' as used in section 71 the Constitution mean the power which every sovereign author ity must of necessity have to decide controversies between its subjects, or between itself and its subjects, whether the rights relate to life, liberty or property.\\r\\nThe exer cise of this power does not begin [19311 A. C. 275.\\r\\n(2) ; , 357. 477 until some tribunal which has power to give a binding and authoritative decision (whether subject to appeal or not) is called upon to take action.\\r\\n\" It was conceded that a tribunal constituted under the , exercises quasi judicial powers.\\r\\nThat phrase implies that a certain content of the judicial power of the State is vestedit and it is called upon to exercise it.\\r\\nAn attempt was made to define the words \"judicial\" and \"quasi judicial\" in the case of Cooper vs Wilson (1).\\r\\nThe relevant quotation reads thus : \"A true judicial decision presupposes an existing dis pute between two or more parties, and then involves four requisites : (1) The presentation necessarily orally) of their case by the parties to the dispute; (2) if the dispute between them is a question of fact, the ascertainment of the fact by means of evidence adduced by the parties to the dispute and often with the assistance of argument by or on behalf of the parties on the evidence; (3) if the dispute between them is a question of law, the submission of legal argument by the parties, and (4) a decision which disposes of the whole matter by a finding upon the facts in dispute and application of the law of the land to the facts so found, including where required a ruling upon any disputed question of law.\\r\\nA quasi judicial decision equally presup poses an existing \\' dispute between two or more parties and involves (1) and (2), but does not necessarily involve (3) and never involves (4).\\r\\nThe place of (4)is in fact taken by administrative action, the character of which is determined by the Minister \\'s free choice.\\r\\n\" The extent of judicial power exercised by an ]industrial Tribunal will be considered hereinafter in the light of the observations cited above.\\r\\nReference was made to certain passages from Professor Allen \\'s book on Law and Order, Chapter IV, page 69, where mention is made of the kinds of administrative tribunals functioning in various countries today.\\r\\nPorter on Adminis trative Law, 1929 Edn., (1) , at p. 340.\\r\\n478 page 194, was also relied upon.\\r\\nThere can be no doubt that varieties of administrative tribunals and domestic tribunals are known to exist in this country as well as in other countries of the world but the real question to decide in each case is as to the extent of judicial power of the State exercised by them.\\r\\nTribunals which do not derive authority from the sovereign power cannot fall within the ambit of article 136.\\r\\nThe condition precedent for bringing a tribu nal within the ambit of article 136 is that it should be constituted by the State.\\r\\nAgain a tribunal would be outside the ambit of article 136 if it is not invested with any part of the judicial functions of the State but discharges purely administrative or executive duties.\\r\\nTribunals, however, which are found invested with certain functions of a Court of justice and have some of its trappings also would fall within the ambit of article 136 and would be subject to the appellate control of this Court whenever it is found neces sary to exercise that control in the interests of justice.\\r\\nIt is now convenient to consider whether a tribunal constituted under the , exer cises all or any one of the functions of a Court of justice and whether it discharges them according to law or whether it can act as it likes in its deliberations and is guided by its own notions of right and wrong.\\r\\nThe phrase \"industrial dispute\" has been defined in section 2 clause (k) of the Act as follows : \"any dispute or difference between employers and em ployees, or between employers and workmen, or between work men and workmen, which is connected with the employment or non employment or the terms of employment or with the condi tions of labour, of any person.\\r\\n\" Such a dispute concerns the rights of employers and employees.\\r\\nIts decision affects the terms of a contract of service or the conditions of employment.\\r\\nNot only may the pecuniary liability of an employer be considerably affect ed by the adjudication of such dispute but it may even result in the imposition of punishments on him.\\r\\nIt may adversely 479 affect the employees as well.\\r\\nAdjudication of such a dis pute affects valuable rights.\\r\\nThe dispute and its result can always be translated in terms of money.\\r\\nThe point for decision in the dispute usually is how much money has to pass out of the pocket of the employer to the pocket of the employee in one form or another and to what extent the right of freedom of contract stands modified to bring about indus trial peace.\\r\\nPower to adjudicate on such a dispute is given by section 7 of the statute to an Industrial Tribunal and a duty is cast on it to adjudicate it in accordance with the provisions o Act.\\r\\nThe words underlined clearly imply that the dispute has to be adjudicated according to law and not in any other manner.\\r\\nWhen the dispute has to be adjudicated in accordance with the provisions of the Act, it follows that the tribunal has to adhere to law, though that law may be different from the law that an ordinary Court of justice administers.\\r\\nIt is noteworthy that the tribunal is to consist of experienced judicial officers and its award is defined as a determination of the dispute.\\r\\nThe expression \"adjudication\" implies that the tribunal is to act as a judge of the dispute; in other words, it sits as a Court of justice and does not occupy the chair of an administrator.\\r\\nIt is pertinent to point out that the tribunal is not given any executive or administrative powers.\\r\\nIn section 38 of the Act power is given to make rules for the purpose of giving effect to the provisions of the Act.\\r\\nSuch rules can provide in respect of matters which concern the powers and procedure of tribunals including rules as to the summoning of witness es, the production of documents relevant to the subject matter and as to appearance of legal practitioners in pro ceedings under this Act.\\r\\nRule 3 of these rules provides that any application for the reference of an industrial dispute to a tribunal shall be made in form (A) and shall be accompanied by a statement setting forth, inter alia, the names of the parties to the dispute and the specific matters of dispute.\\r\\nIt is in a sense in the nature of a plaint in a suit.\\r\\nIn rule 13 power is given to administer oaths.\\r\\nRule 14 provides as follows : \"A tribunal may accept, admit or call for 480 evidence at any stage of the proceedings before it and in such manner as it may think fit.\\r\\n\" Rule 17 provides that at its first sitting the tribunal is.\\r\\nto call upon the parties to state their case.\\r\\nIn rule 19 provision has been made for proceedings ex parte.\\r\\nRule 21 provides that in addition to the powers conferred by sub section (3) of section 11 of the Act, a tribunal shall have the same powers as are vested in a civil Court under the Code of Civil Procedure when trying a suit, in respect of the following matters, namely, (a) discovery and inspection; (b) granting of adjournment; (c) reception of evidence taken on affidavit; and that the tribunal may summon and examine suo motu any person whose evidence appears to it to be material.\\r\\nIt further says that the tribunal shall be deemed to be a civil Court within the meaning of sections 480 and 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 189S. Rule 21 says that the representatives of the parties, appearing before a tribunal, shall have the right of examination, cross exami nation and re examination and.\\r\\nof addressing the Court or Tribunal when all evidence has been called.\\r\\nIn rule 30 it is provided that a, party to a reference may be represented by a legal practitioner with the permission of the tribunal and subject to such conditions as the tribunal may impose.\\r\\nIn section 11 (3) it is laid down that a tribunal shall have the same powers as are vested in a civil Court under the Code of Civil Procedure when trying a suit, in respect of the following matters, namely, (a) enforcing the attendance of any person and examining him on oath; (b) compelling the production of documents and material objects; (c) issuing commissions for the examination of witnesses; (d) in respect of such other matters as may be prescribed; and every in quiry or investigation by a tribunal shall be deemed to be a judicial proceeding within the meaning of sections 193 and 228 of the Indian Penal Code.\\r\\nIt is difficult to conceive in view of these provisions that the Industrial Tribunal per forms any funCtions other than that of a judicial nature.\\r\\nThe tribunal has certainly the first three requisites and characteristics of a Court as defined above.\\r\\nIt has cer tainly a considerable element of the fourth also inasmuch as. 481 the tribunal cannot take any administrative action, the character of which is determined by its own choice.\\r\\nIt has to make the adjudication in accordance with the provisions of the Act as laid down in section 7.\\r\\nIt consists of persons who are qualified to be or have been judges.\\r\\nIt is its duty to adjudicate on a serious dispute between employers and employees as affecting their right of freedom of contract and it can impose liabilities of a pecuniary nature and disobedience of its award is made punishable.\\r\\nThe powers exercisable by a tribunal of this nature were considered in a judgment \\' of the Federal Court of India in Western India Automobile Association vs Industrial Tribunal, Bombay (x), and it was observed that such a tribunal can do what no Court can, namely, add to or alter the terms or condi tions of the contract of service.\\r\\nThe tribunal having been entrusted with the duty of adjudicating a dispute of a peculiar character, it is for this reason that it is armed with extraordinary powers.\\r\\nThese powers, however, are derived from the statute.\\r\\nThese are the rules of the game and it has to decide according to these rules.\\r\\nThe powers conferred have the sanction of law behind it and are not exercisable by reason of any discretion vested in the members of the tribunal.\\r\\nThe adjudication of the dispute has to be in accordance with evidence legally adduced and the parties have a right to be heard and being represented by a legal practitioner.\\r\\nRight to examine and cross examine witnesses has been given to the parties and finally they can address the tribunal when evidence is closed.\\r\\nThe whole procedure adopted by the Act and the rules is modelled on the Code of Civil Procedure.\\r\\nIn my opinion, therefore, the Industrial Tribunal has all the necessary attributes of a Court of justice.\\r\\nIt has no other function except that of adjudicating on a dispute.\\r\\nIt is no doubt true that by reason of the nature of the dispute that they have to adju dicate the law gives them wider powers than are possessed by ordinary Courts of law, but powers of such a nature do not affect (1) [1949]] F.C.R. 321.\\r\\n482 the question that they are exercising judicial power.\\r\\nStat utes like the Relief of Indebtedness Act, or the Encumbered Estates Act have conferred powers on Courts which are not ordinarily known to law and which affect contractual rights.\\r\\nThat circumstance does not make them anything else but tribunals exercising judicial power of the State, though in a degree.\\r\\ndifferent from the ordinary Courts and.\\r\\nto an extent which is also different from that enjoyed by an ordinary Court of law.\\r\\nThey may rightly be described as quasi judicial bodies because they are out of the hierarchy of the ordinary judicial system but that circumstance cannot affect the question of their being within the ambit of article 136.\\r\\nIt may also be observed that the tribunal is deemed to be a civil Court for certain purposes as laid down in rule 21 of the rules above cited and in section 11(3) of the Act.\\r\\nAs a civil Court if it exercises any of the powers contem plated by this section its decisions would become subject to appeal to a District Judge and a fortiori this Court \\'s power under article 136.\\r\\nwould at once be attracted in any case in respect of these matters.\\r\\nAgain, in Chapter VI of the Act breach of the terms of an award has been made punishable by section 29 of the Act.\\r\\nThe result therefore, is that disobedience of the terms of an award is punishable under the Act.\\r\\nThat being so, a determination of the tribu nal not only affects the freedom of contract and imposes pecuniary liability on the employer or confers pecuniary benefits on the employees, but it also involves serious consequences as failure to observe those terms makes a person liable to the penalties laid down in Chapter VI.\\r\\nAn award which has these serious consequences can hardly be said to have been given by a tribunal which does not exer cise some of the most important judicial functions of the State.\\r\\nConsiderable stress was laid by Mr. Alladi on the provi sions of sections 15 and 19 of the Act.\\r\\nSection 15 enacts as follows : \"(1) Where an industrial dispute has been referred to a Tribunal for adjudication, it shall hold its 483 proceedings expeditiously and shall, as soon as practicable on the conclusion thereof, submit its award to the appropri ate Government.\\r\\n(2) On receipt of such award, the appropriate Govern ment shall by order in writing declare the award to be binding.\\r\\nProvided that where the appropriate Government is a party to the dispute and in its opinion it would be inexpe dient on public grounds to give effect to the whole or any part of the award, it shall on the first available opportu nity lay the award together with the statement of its rea sons for not making a declaration as aforesaid before the Legislative Assembly of the province, or where the appropri ate Government, is the Central Government, before the Cen tral Legislature, an d shall, as soon as may be, cause to be moved therein a resolution for the consideration of the award; and the Legislative Assembly or as the case may be, the Central Legislature, may by its resolution confirm, modify or reject the award.\\r\\n(3) On the passing of a resolution under the proviso to sub section (2), unless the award is rejected thereby, the appropriate Government shall11 by order in writing declare the award as confirmed or modified by the resolution, as the case may be, to be binding.\\r\\n(4) Save as provided in the proviso to subsection (3) of section 19, an award declared to be binding under this section shall not be called in question in any manner.\\r\\n\" As regards clause (4), it was conceded rightly that a law dealing with industrial disputes and enacted in the year 1947 could not in any way,affect the provisions of the Constitution laid down in article 136.\\r\\nIt was however, strenuously urged that the award of the tribunal had no binding force by itself and unless the appropriate Govern ment made a declaration in writing under clause (2) of section 15, this award was a lifeless document and had no sanction behind it and therefore it could not have been contemplated that if would be appealable even by special leave.\\r\\nIn my opinion, this contention is unsound.\\r\\nThe provisions of clause (2) of 484 section 15 leave no discretion in the Government either to affirm, modify or reject the award.\\r\\nIt is bound to declare it binding.\\r\\nIt has no option in the matter.\\r\\nIn such a situation it is the determination by the tribunal that matters.\\r\\nWithout that determination Government cannot function.\\r\\nIt does not possess the power either to adjudi cate the dispute or to alter it in any manner whatsoever.\\r\\nThat power vests in the tribunal alone.\\r\\nThe rights of the parties are really affected by the adjudication contained in the award, not by the Government \\'s declaration which is automatic.\\r\\nIt is no doubt true that announcement of the award by the Government gives it binding force but that does not affect the question of the appealability of the determination under article 136 of the Constitution.\\r\\nThe apposite answer to this contention may be given in the language of the decision in Rex vs Electricity Commissioners (1).\\r\\nThe relevant passage runs thus : \"It is necessary, however, to deal with what I think was the main objection of the Attorney General.\\r\\nIn this case he said the Commissioners come to no decision at all.\\r\\nThey act merely as advisers.\\r\\nThey recommend an order embodying a scheme to the Minister of Transport, who may confirm it with or without modifications.\\r\\nSimilarly the Minister of Trans port comes to no decision.\\r\\nHe submits the order to the Houses of parliament, who may approve it with or without modifications.\\r\\nThe Houses of Parliament may put anything into the order they please, whether consistent with the Act of 1919, or not.\\r\\nUntil they have approved, nothing is decided, and in truth the whole procedure, draft scheme, inquiry, order, confirmation, approval, is only part of a process by which Parliament is expressing its will, and at no stage is subject to, any control by the Courts.\\r\\nIt is unnecessary to emphasize the constitutional importance of this contention.\\r\\nGiven its full effect, it means that the checks and safeguards which have been imposed by Act of Parliament, including the freedom from compulsory taking, can be removed, and new and onerous and (1) , at 207.\\r\\n485 inconsistent obligations imposed without an Act of Parlia ment, and by simple resolution of both Houses of Parliament.\\r\\nI do not find it necessary to determine whether, on the proper construction of the statute, resolutions of the two Houses of Parliament could have the effect claimed.\\r\\nIn the provision that the final decision of the Commissioners is not to be operative until it has been approved by the two Houses of Parliament I find nothing inconsistent with the view that they act judicially and within the limits pre scribed by Act of Parliament, and that the Courts have power to keep them within those limits.\\r\\nIt is to be noted that it is the order of the Commissioners that eventually takes effect, neither the Minister of Transport who confirms, nor the Houses of Parliament who approve.\\r\\ncan under the statute make an order which in respect of the matters in question has any operation.\\r\\nI know of no authority which compels me to hold that a proceeding cannot be a judicial proceeding subject to confirmation or approval, even where the approval has to be that of the Houses of Parliament.\\r\\nThe authorities are to the contrary The observations, though they relate to a case which concerns the issue of a writ of prohibition and certiorari, have application to the present case.\\r\\nHere no discretion whatsoever has been left in the Government in ordinary cases to either modify or t0 reject the determination of the tribunal.\\r\\nThe fact that the Government has to make a decla ration after the final decision of the tribunal is not in any way inconsistent with the view that the tribunal acts judicially.\\r\\nIt may also be pointed out that within the statute itself a clue has been provided which shows that the circumstance that the award has to be declared by an order of Government to be binding does not affect the question of its appealability.\\r\\nIn article 136 clause (2) express provi sion has been made for excepting from the ambit of article 136 the decisions of military courts and tribunals.\\r\\nIt follows that but for the exception it was considered that these would be within article 136 clause (1).\\r\\nIt is quite clear from the various provisions of the Army Act that the decisions of military tribunals or courts are subject to confirmation either by 486 the Commander in Chief or various other military authori ties.\\r\\nIt is only after such confirmation that \\'that can operate.\\r\\nIt has never been considered that fact in any way affects the question of their appealability.\\r\\nRex vs Minister of Health (1) also supports this view.\\r\\nThere by the Housing Act, 1925, by section 40, a local authority which had prepared an improvement scheme was required to present a petition to the Minister praying that an order should be made confirming such scheme.\\r\\nSub section (3) provided that the Minister after considering the peti tion may cause a local inquiry to be made and may by order confirm the scheme with or without conditions or modifica tions.\\r\\nIn sub section (5) it was stated that the order of the Minister when made shall have effect as if enacted in this Act.\\r\\nIt was held be the Court of Appeal that as the order made by the Minister was made without the statutory conditions having been complied with it was ultra vires and therefore a writ of certiorari should issue for the purpose of quashing it.\\r\\nReliance was placed by Scrutton L.J. on Rex vs Electricity Commissioners (2).\\r\\nThe same.view was ex pressed in Minister of Health vs The King (3).\\r\\nIt was observed that judicial review by prohibition or a writ of certiorari was permissible if the Minister of Health in confirming the order exceeded his statutory powers.\\r\\nIt is clear therefore that simply because an order has to be confirmed by a Minister or by the Government it in any way affects the power of judicial review.\\r\\nReference may also be made to the observations in Smith vs The Queen (4).\\r\\nAt page 623 it was observed that it is a common principle in every case which has in itself the character of a judicial pro ceeding that the party against whom a judgment is to operate shall have an opportunity of being heard.\\r\\nIn this sense it can hardly be disputed that the proceeding before an indus trial Tribunal is a judicial proceeding.\\r\\nIn my judgment, therefore, the contention raised by Mr. Alladi that this (1) (3) [1931] A.C. 494; (2) (4) 3 A.C. 245.\\r\\n487 Court cannot exercise its powers under article because the decision of the tribunal has no force till a declaration is made by the Government cannot be sustained.\\r\\nAs regards section 19, it was contended that an award declared by the appropriate Government under section 15 to be binding can only come into operation on such date as may be specified by the appropriate Government and can only remain in operation for such period not exceeding one year, as may be fixed by that Government and it was said that herein the Government had the power to state the period from which the award was to commence and the time for which it was to remain in force.\\r\\nThis section does not, in my opin ion, affect the question of the appealability of the deter mination of the tribunal.\\r\\nGovernment has certain functions to perform in its own sphere after the award is made.\\r\\nIn certain cases it is bound to declare that award binding.\\r\\nIn other cases, when it is itself a party to the dispute, it has certain overriding powers and these overriding powers are that if it considers that the award is not in public interests it may refer it to the legislature.\\r\\nThe legisla ture, however, has the power to modify, accept or reject the award.\\r\\nThese overriding powers presuppose the existence of a valid determination by a tribunal.\\r\\nIf that determina tion is in excess of jurisdiction or otherwise proceeds in a manner that offends against the rules of natural justice and is set aside by exercise of power under article 136, then no occasion arises for exercise of governmental power under the Act.\\r\\nGiven a valid award, it could not be denied that the Government could exercise its powers in any manner it con sidered best and the exercise of that power is outside the constitution of this Court.\\r\\nIn this connection reference was made to Moses vs Parker (1).\\r\\nThe passage on which emphasis was laid reads as follows : \"The Court has been substituted for the commissioners to report to the governor.\\r\\nThe difference is that their report is to be binding on him.\\r\\nProbably it was (1) [1896] A.C. 488 thought that the status and training of the judges made them the most proper depositaries of that power.\\r\\nBut that does not make their action a judicial action in the sense that it can be tested and altered by appeal.\\r\\nIt is no more judicial than was the action of the commissioners and the governor.\\r\\nThe Court is to be guided by equity and good conscience and the best evidence.\\r\\nSo were the commissioners.\\r\\nSo every public officer ought to be.\\r\\nBut they are expressly exoner ated from all rules of law and equity, and all legal forms.\\r\\nHow then can the propriety of their decision be tested on appeal ? What are the canons by \\'which this Board is to be guided in advising Her Majesty whether the Supreme Court is right or wrong ? It seems almost impossible that decisions can be varied except by reference to some rule, whereas the Court making them is free from rules.\\r\\nIf appeals were allowed, the certain result would be to establish some system of rules, and that is the very thing from which the Tasmanian Legislature has desired to leave the Supreme Court free and unfettered in each case.\\r\\nIf it were clear that appeals ought to be allowed such difficulties would doubt less be met somehow.\\r\\nBut there are strong arguments to show that the matter is not of an appreciable nature.\\r\\n\" One would have expected that after this opinion the decision would have been that the Judicial Committee had no jurisdiction to entertain the appeal but their Lordships proceeded to base their decision not on this ground but on the ground that this was not a fit case for the exercise of the prerogative of the King.\\r\\nIn my opinion, the observations made in that case have no apposite application to the provi sions of the statute with which we are concerned.\\r\\nI do not see any difficulty in this case in testing the propriety of the determination of the tribunal.\\r\\nThis Court is not to substitute its decision for the determination of the tribu nal when granting relief under article 136.\\r\\nWhen it chooses to interfere in the exercise of these extraordinary powers, it does so because the tribunal has either exceeded its jurisdiction or has approached the questions referred to it in a manner which is likely to 489 result in injustice or has adopted a procedure which runs counter to the well established rules of natural justice.\\r\\nIn other words, if it ,has denied a hearing to a party or has refused to record his evidence or has acted in any other manner, in an arbitrary or despotic fashion.\\r\\nIn such cir cumstances no question arises of this Court constituting itself into a tribunal and assuming powers of settling a dispute.\\r\\nAll that the Court when it entertains an appeal would do is to quash the award and direct the tribunal to proceed within the powers conferred on it and approach the adjudication of the dispute according to principles of natural justice.\\r\\nThis Court under article 136 would not constitute itself into a mere court of error.\\r\\nExtraordinary powers have to be exercised in rare and exceptional cases and on well known principles.\\r\\nConsidered in the light of these principles, there is no insuperable difficulty in the present case of the nature pointed out in the passage cited above.\\r\\nIt was conceded that the High Court could exercise powers under section 226 and could quash an award but it was said that under article 136 this power should not be exer cised in an appeal.\\r\\nI do not see why ? Particularly when after the High Court has passed any decision on an applica tion made to it in exercise of the powers under section 226, that decision could be brought to this Court in appeal.\\r\\nIn the matter of an industrial dispute where expedition is the crux of the matter, it is essential that any abuse of powers by such tribunals is corrected as soon as possible and with expedition.\\r\\nIt may be mentioned that it is no novel practice for a court empowered to grant special leave to exercise its powers even though there may be intermediate rights of appeal or other remedies available, if it is considered essential to do so in extraordinary situations.\\r\\nVide Bent wick \\'s Privy Council Practice, 3rd Edn., page 125.\\r\\nTherein it is stated as follows : \"In several cases from Jamaica, the Privy Council grant ed leave to appeal to the Queen in Council directly from the Supreme Court, without an intermediate appeal (which would have been attended with much 490 expense and delay) to the Court of Error in the island, there being in each of those cases manifestly some point of law raised which deserved discussion.\\r\\n\" The cases were In Re Barnett(1), Harrison vs Scott (2), and Attorney General of Jamacia vs Manderson (s).\\r\\nThe phraseology employed in article 136 itself justifies this course.\\r\\nThe article empowers this Court to grant special leave against sentences or orders made by any court.\\r\\nIn all other articles of the Constitution right of appeal is con ferred against final decisions of the highest court of appeal in the country but under this article power is given to this Court to circumvent that procedure if it is considered necessary to do so.\\r\\nI am, therefore, of the opinion that the mere circumstance that a remedy in the nature of a writ of certiorari is open to the petitioners does not necessarily lead to the conclusion that the power of this Court under article 136 is circumscribed by that circumstance.\\r\\nWhenever judicial review is permissible in one form or another, this Court as the highest Court in the land can exercise its special powers and circumvent ordinary procedure by granting special leave.\\r\\nWhat it has to ulti mately decide it can decide earlier.\\r\\nI now proceed to examine some of the cases to which reference was made by Mr. Alladi.\\r\\nThree Australian cases were cited which concern the construction of sections 51, 71 and 72 of the Australian Constitution (63 and 64 Vict., c. 12).\\r\\nSection 72 requires that every Justice of the High Court and every Justice of any other Court created by the Parliament of the Common wealth shall subject to the power of removal contained in the section be appointed for life.\\r\\nSection 71 confers the whole judicial power of the Commonwealth upon the Courts therein mentioned and no other tribunal or body can exercise that power.\\r\\nEvery Court referred to in section 71 has to be constituted in the manner provided by section 72.\\r\\nThe ques tion in these cases was as to the meaning of the phrase \"judicial power of the Commonwealth.\\r\\n\" Similar (1) 4 Moo. 453. (2) 5 Moo. 357. (3) 6 Moo. 239. 491 phraseology has not been used in any part of the Constitu tion of India and in these circumstances it is difficult to derive any assistance from these decisions in solving the problem before us.\\r\\nThe Constitution of India is not mo delled on the Constitution of Australia and that being so, any observations made in decisions given under that Consti tution cannot be held to be a safe guide in the interpreta tion of language employed in a Constitution differently drafted.\\r\\nThe first of these cases is Waterside Workers \\' Federa tion of Australia vs\\r\\nJ.W. Alexander Ltd. (1).\\r\\nTherein it was held that the power conferred by the Commonwealth Concilia tion and Arbitration Act 1904 1915 upon the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration to enforce awards made by it is part of \"the judicial power of the Commonwealth \"within the meaning of section 71 of the Constitution, and can only be vested in the courts mentioned in that section.\\r\\nMr. Alladi placed reliance on a passage at page 467 in the judgment of Isaacs and Rich JJ., which reads as follows : \"The arbitral part of the Act, therefore, is quite within the power of pl. xxxv, and is not intended by the Act to be exercised by an ordinary Court of Justice, which, it is suggested, Parliament by some strange perversity proceed ed to destroy at birth.\\r\\nIt is true that enforcement provi sions are found. .\\r\\nBut all this was in imitation of the State Acts of Arbitration, and not in reliance on the Judi cature Chapter of the Federal Constitution.\\r\\nThe arbitral portion of the Act is, in our opinion, perfectly good, subject to its severability from any other portion which may be bad.\\r\\n\" It was argued that the Industrial Tribunal here was an arbitration tribunal of the same kind as in Australia and exercises similar functions.\\r\\nIt is however pertinent to observe that the phraseology employed in section 15 of the Indian Act is different from that used in the Australian statute.\\r\\nThe Indian statute has constituted different bodies for different purposes.\\r\\nAn Industrial Tribunal has been constituted (1) 25 C.L.R. 63 492 only to discharge one function of adjudication.\\r\\nIt is not described as an arbitral tribunal.\\r\\nThe Act has avoided the use of the word \"arbitration\" either in preamble or in any of its relevant provisions though the determination has been named as an award.\\r\\nIn these circumstances it is unsafe to seek any guidance from observations made in this case.\\r\\nThe next case to which reference was made is Rola Co. (Australia) Proprietary Ltd. vs The Commonwealth (1).\\r\\nThe question here was whether the Women \\'s Employment Board constituted under the Women \\'s Employment Act, 1942, did not exercise the judicial power of the Commonwealth.\\r\\nIt was held that the Board exercised functions which were arbitral in character.\\r\\nEmphasis was laid on a passage occurring in page 198 of the report which reads as follows : \"An industrial award lays down rules of conduct for the future.\\r\\nIt does not purport to ascertain and enforce exist ing rights; it is directed to the creation of new rights.\\r\\nIt is urged on behalf of the plaintiff that a determination of the Committee does not create a rule of conduct binding the parties for the future, but that it authoritatively deter mines a possibly controverted question of fact and that the making of such an authoritative determination is necessarily an exercise of judicial power.\\r\\nReference is made to the frequently quoted statement of Griffith C.J. in Huddart Parker & Co. Pty. Ltd. vs Moorehead (2), approved by the Privy Council in Shell Co. of Australia Ltd. vs Federal Commissioner of Taxation (8):__ \"I am of opinion that the words \\'judicial power \\' as used in section 71 of the Constitution mean the power which every sovereign authority must of necessity have to decide controverises between its subjects or between itself and its subjects, whether the rights relate to life, liberty or property.\\r\\nThe exercise of this power does not begin until some tribunal which has power to give a binding and authori tative decision (whether subject to appeal or not) is called upon to take action.\" (1) ; (2) a C.L.R. 330 at 357.\\r\\n(3) 493 Reg.\\r\\n5C gives Committees power.\\r\\nto decide controversies between subjects relating to their rights and the regulation purports to make those decisions binding and authoritative.\\r\\nI am not satisfied that the words of Griffith C.J. are properly interpreted when it is said that they mean that a power to make binding and authoritative decisions as to facts is necessarily judicial power.\\r\\nI direct attention to the concluding words \" is called upon to take action.\\r\\n\" In my opinion these words are directed to action to be taken by a tribunal which has power to give a binding and authorita tive decision.\\r\\nThe mere giving of the decision is not the action to which the learned Chief Justice referred.\\r\\nIf a body which has power to give a binding and authoritative decision is able to take action so as to enforce that deci sion, then, but only then, according to the definition quoted, all the attributes of judicial power are plainly present.\\r\\nI refer to what I say more in detail hereafter, that the Privy Council, in the Shell case (1), in which approval was given to the definition quoted, expressly held that a tribunal was not necessarily a Court because it gave decisions (even final decisions) between contending parties which affected their rights.\\r\\nIn Huddart Parker \\'s case (2), Isaacs 1. referred to the statement of Palles C.B. in R.v.\\r\\nLocal Government Board for Ireland (3) \"to erect a tribunal into a \\'Court \\' or \\'juris diction \\', so as to make its determinations judicial, the essential element is that it should have power, by its determination within jurisdiction, to impose liability or affect rights.\" \"By this,\" said the learned Chief Baron, \"I mean that the liability is imposed, or the right affected by the determination only, and not by the fact determined, and so that the liability will exist, or the right will be affected, although the determination be wrong in law or in fact.\\r\\nIt is otherwise of a ministerial power.\\r\\nIf the existence of such a power depends upon a contingency, al though it may be necessary for the officer to determine whether (1) (2) ; at 383.\\r\\n(3) at p. 373.\\r\\n494 the contingency has happened, in order to know whether he shall exercise the power, his determination does not bind.\\r\\nThe happening of the contingency may be questioned in an action brought to try the the act done under the alleged exercise of the power.\\r\\nBut where the determination binds, although it is based on an erroneous view of facts or law, then the power authorizing it is judicial.\\r\\nThere we get a modern use of the term \\'judicial power \\'.\\r\\n\" This state ment of the characteristics of judicial power looks to what, in Waterside Workers \\' Federation of Australia vs Gilchrist, Watt & Sanderson Ltd.(1), Isaacs and Rich JJ.\\r\\nreferred to as the creation of instant liability in specified persons as distinct from laying down a rule or standard of conduct for the future.\\r\\nThe decision of an ordinary Court that B is bound to pay money to A applies a pre existing standard of rights and duties not created by the Court itself, with the result that there is an immediately enforceable liability of B to pay to A the sum of money in question.\\r\\nThe decision of the Wom en \\'s Employment Board does not create any such liability, nor does the determination of a Committee of Reference create any such liability.\\r\\nIn order to impose an immediale ly enforceable liability upon any employer, for example, to pay wages to a particular female, it would be necessary for the female or some person on her behalf (see reg.\\r\\n9A) to sue in a court of competent jurisdiction.\\r\\nIf such a proceeding succeeded there would then be a liability created by the determination of the court.\\r\\nsuch a proceeding the determina tion of the Committee of Reference would be evidence of the facts to which it related, but that determination would not in itself create \"liability.\\r\\n\" The concluding words of the passage quoted above at once distinguish the present case from the Australian case.\\r\\nThe award given by an Industrial Tribunal in respect either of bonus or higher wages, etc.\\r\\nis enforceable by its own force and by the coercive machienary of the Act and it is not merely a declaration of a character that furnishes a cause of action to the employee to bring a suit on its foot to recover the C.L.R. 482, 512.\\r\\n495 wages.\\r\\nAn arbitral tribunal \\'s decision cannot be enforced unless it has the sanction of a Court of justice behind it but the award of the Tribunal is enforceable under the Act itself by the coercive machinery provided therein.\\r\\nIt is the terms of the award that are enforceable and not the terms of the order made by the Government.\\r\\nIt is the breach of the terms of the award that is punishable and not any breach of Government \\'s order.\\r\\nThe Government itself is bound to declare the award binding and it has no option whatsoever in the matter.\\r\\nIt is no doubt true that the tribunal has not only to decide the existing rights and liabilities of the parties and it can lay down rules of conduct for the future but it does so because by law it is authorised to do so.\\r\\nIts decision carries the sanction with it.\\r\\nThe Government is bound to give effect to it and the statute enforces it by coercive machinery.\\r\\nIn my view, therefore, this decision again has no relevancy to the present case.\\r\\nThe third case to which reference was made is Shell Co. of Australia vs Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1).\\r\\nThat was an income tax matter and the decision has been consid ered in an earlier part of this judgment.\\r\\nReference was also made to Mohammad Ahmad vs Governor General in Council (\"), in which it was held that an improvement trust was not a civil Court subordinate to the High Court under section 115 of the Code of Civil Procedure.\\r\\nThat has no bearing to the matter in issue here.\\r\\nSimilar point was discussed in Hari vs Secretary of State for India (3).\\r\\nLabour Relations Board vs John East Iron Works Ltd. (4) is a Canadian case and the decision proceeded on the same lines as in the Australian cases.\\r\\nMr. Sen appearing for the respondents placed reliance on O \\'Connor vs Waldron (5).\\r\\nThe relevant passage occurs at page 81 which runs thus : The law as to judicial privilege has in process of time developed.\\r\\nOriginally it was intended for the protection of judges sitting in recognised Courts of (1) (3) I.L.R. (2) I.L.R. (4) A.I.R. 1949 P.C. 129.\\r\\n(5) , 496 Justice established as such.\\r\\nThe object no doubt was that judges might exercise their functions free from any danger that they might be called to account for any words spoken as judges.\\r\\nThe doctrine has been extended to tribunals exer cising functions equivalent to those of an established Court of Justice.\\r\\nIn their Lordships \\' opinion the law on the subject was accurately stated by Lord Esher in Royal Aquari um etc.\\r\\nLtd. vs Parkinson (1), where he says that the privi lege applies wherever there is an authorized inquiry which, though not before a Court of Justice, is before a tribunal which has similar attributes.\\r\\nThis doctrine has never been extended further than to Courts of Justice and tribunals acting in a manner similar to that in which such Courts act \\'\" The learned counsel contended that the. word \"tribunal\" in article 136 could only have reference to those tribunals which exercise functions equivalent to that of a Court of Justice.\\r\\nI have no hesitation in holding that the Industrial Tribunal has similar attributes as that of a Court of Jus tice in view of the various provisions to which I have made reference.\\r\\nReference was also made to certain passages occuring in pages 422 and 428 of Toronto Corporation vs York Corporation (2).\\r\\nThat was a case of the Municipal Board of Ontario.\\r\\nIt was held there that the Board was merely an administrative tribunal.\\r\\nNext reliance was placed on R.v.\\r\\nNational Arbitration Tribunal, Ex parte Horatio Crowther & Co. Ltd.(3).\\r\\nThat dealt with the powers of tile National Arbitration Tribunal.\\r\\nIn my opinion this citation also is not of much assistance.\\r\\nIt was again urged by Mr. Alladi that the word \"tribu nal\" was introduced in the article to provide for cases of tribunals like the Board of Revenue.\\r\\nThe suggestion does not appear to be sound, because a Revenue Board has all the attributes of a Court of justice and falls within the defi nition of the word \"Court\" in matters where it adjudicates on rights of parties.\\r\\n(6) (7) [1938] A.C. &15.\\r\\n(8) 497 The word \"tribunal\" has been used in previous legisla tion in a number of statutes and it is difficult to think that the Constitution when it introduced this word in arti cle 136 intended to limit its meaning to only those tribu nals which though not described as Courts strictly speaking, were discharging the same or analogous functions as were being discharged by Courts.\\r\\nFor the reasons given above I am of the opinion that the word \"tribunal\" in article 136 has to be construed liberally and not in any narrow sense and an Industrial Tribunal inasmuch as it discharges functions of a judicial nature in accordance with law comes within the ambit of the article and from its determination an application for spe cial leave is competent.\\r\\nThe question now to determine is whether the exercise of overriding powers of this Court can be justified on any ground whatsoever in the present case.\\r\\nAs I have already said, exceptional and extraordinary powers of this character can only be justifiably used where there has been a grave miscarriage of justice or where the procedure adopted by the Tribunal is such that it offends against all notions of legal procedure.\\r\\nDr. Bakshi Tek Chand for the petitioner bank urged four grounds justifying exercise of the special jurisdiction of this Court.\\r\\nFirstly, he contended that the word \"victimiza tion\" used in clause 18 of the reference had been interpret ed in such a manner by the Tribunal that it had usurped jurisdiction to decide disputes which were never referred to it.\\r\\nIn my view this is not a matter which can justify the exercise of the powers under article 136.\\r\\nThis Court is not a mere Court of error.\\r\\nThe word \"victimization\" has not been defined in the statute and is not in any sense a term of law or a term of article It is an ordinary English word which means that a certain person has become a victim, in other words, that he has been unjustly dealt with.\\r\\nIt was argued that the word has acquired a special meaning in regard to industrial disputes and connotes a person who becomes a victim of the employer \\'s wrath by reason of his trade union activities and that the word cannot relate to a person who has been merely unjustly dismissed.\\r\\nBe that as it may.\\r\\n498 The determination of the Tribunal has not been materially affected by this interpretation of the word to any large extent and that being so, it does not call for the exercise of the special power.\\r\\nThe second ground urged was that the Tribunal has erred in ordering reinstatement of persons who were guilty of an illegal strike.\\r\\nIt was contended that section 23 (b) of the Act has been wrongly construed by it and as a result of this misconstruction persons who were guilty of a wrong and who could not have been reinstated have been reinstated.\\r\\nIn brief, the argument was that under section 23(b) when a matter has been referred to a tribunal in respect of an earlier strike, any strike during the pendency of that dispute is an illegal strike and that was the situation here.\\r\\nThe employees of the bank had struck work in December, 1948.\\r\\nThat dispute had been referred to an Industrial Tribunal.\\r\\nIt was during the pendency of that dispute that another strike took place which led to the dismissal of the employees who have now been reinstated by the present award.\\r\\nThe Calcutta High Court has held that a strike during the pendency of the period of truce and during the pendency of an earlier dispute before a tribunal is illegal even if it is brought about as a result of fresh and new demands which are not covered by the earlier dispute.\\r\\nOne of the members of the Tribunal thought that the decision laid down the law correctly on the point, but the other member thought that the decision was erroneous.\\r\\nBoth of them, however, agreed that whether the strike was legal or illegal that point did not in any way affect the question that they had to decide under issue 18.\\r\\nThe consequences of an illegal strike are laid down in the Act and certain penalties are provided therein.\\r\\nThe Act nowhere states that persons guilty of illegal strike cannot be reinstated.\\r\\nBe that as it may.\\r\\nThe reference to the Tribunal was made by the Government in respect of an illegal.\\r\\nstrike and the Tribunal was bound to give its decision on the reference.\\r\\nItem 18 of schedule II clearly empowers the tribunal to deal with cases of victimi zation as a result of the third strike which the petitioner described as illegal.\\r\\nThe Tribunal may be 499 wrong in the view they have taken but it seems to me this is again not a question of that vital character which would justify the grant of special leave under article 136.\\r\\nThe next question raised by the learned counsel that the award of the Tribunal is based on no evidence whatsoever.\\r\\nThis contention requires serious consideration.\\r\\nI have examined the proceedings of the Tribunal and it appears that all \\' it did was that as required by rule 17 at the first sitting it called upon the parties to state their cases.\\r\\nMr. Parwana on behalf of the employees stated their respec tive cases and Mr. Ved Vyas who represented the bank stated the bank \\'s case and after the cases had been stated the proceedings terminated and both parties addressed arguments and the Tribunal proceeded to give its award.\\r\\nWhether the charge of victimization in individual cases was proved or not depended on proof of certain facts which had to be established by evidence.\\r\\nThe onus of proving victimization clearly rested on the employees.\\r\\nNo evidence whatsoever was led on their behalf.\\r\\nThe statement of the case by Mr. Parwana was not on oath.\\r\\nThere was no examination or cross examination of Mr. Parwana.\\r\\nNo affidavit supporting the facts stated by Mr. Parwana was filed by him or by any employee.\\r\\nMr. Parwana produced an abstract of the corre spondence but the original correspondence was not produced.\\r\\nThe bank disputed the facts stated by Mr. Parwana by means of a lengthy affidavit.\\r\\nIt seems no reference was made even to this affidavit by the Tribunal.\\r\\nNo counter affidavit was filed in reply to the facts stated in this \\'affidavit.\\r\\nThe bank wanted to call some evidence.\\r\\nParticular reference was made in respect of a scurrilous letter issued by one Bhatta charya on behalf of the employees and distributed by them, which it is alleged considerably shook the credit of the bank.\\r\\nThis opportunity was denied to it.\\r\\nIt was contended before us that the bank wanted to lead evidence on certain matters and that the opportunity to lead it was denied.\\r\\nThere is nothing on the record to support this contention.\\r\\nThe result therefore is that the facts on the basis of which allegations of victimization have been 64 500 made are neither supported by an affidavit nor by any evi dence and the award is based on no evidence whatsoever.\\r\\nThe Act as well as the rules framed under it contemplate a proper hearing, discovery and inspection of documents and production of evidence, etc.\\r\\nNone of this procedure was followed by the Tribunal.\\r\\nIt is difficult to see on what material the Tribunal has given its award as there is none existing on the present record and the respondents \\' counsel could not point out to any such material.\\r\\nAt one time during the argument I was inclined to think that possibly both parties by agreement consented to treat the statement of case as evidence in the case and did not wish to produce any other evidence, but the affidavit filed on behalf of the bank disputes all the facts stated by Mr. Parwana.\\r\\nThe only evidence on the record is the bank \\'s affidavit and if the facts contained in the affidavit are accepted, then the determination made by the Tribunal cannot stand.\\r\\nIt seems to me therefore that the procedure adopted by the Tribunal was against all principles of natural justice and the award is thereby vitiated and should be set aside.\\r\\nIt happens that when the safeguard of an appeal is not provided by law the tendency sometimes is to act in an arbitrary manner like a benevolent despot.\\r\\nBenevolent despotism, however, is foreign to a democratic Constitution.\\r\\nThe members of the Tribunal seem to have thought that having heard the state ment of the cases of the parties they could proceed to a judgment on their own view of its right or wrong unaided by any material.\\r\\nThat kind of procedure to my mind is unwar ranted by the statute and is foreign to a democratic Consti tution.\\r\\nIn these circumstances it is the compelling duty of this Court to exercise its extraordinary powers and to quash such an award.\\r\\nThe last contention raised by Bakshi Tek Chand was that though a Tribunal consisting of three persons was appointed to adjudicate on the dispute, the award has only been signed by two of them.\\r\\nReference in this connection was made to section 16 of the Act which says that the award of a Tribu nal shall be in writing and shall be signed by all the members of the 501 Tribunal and that nothing in the section shall be deemed to prevent any member of the Tribunal from recording a minute of dissent.\\r\\nThe provisions of the section are mandatory and have not been complied with.\\r\\nIt is common ground that the case was stated by the parties at a sitting when all the members of the Tribunal were present and the arguments were heard by all of them.\\r\\nNo sitting took place subsequent to this which would have necessitated the carrying on of pro ceedings by two members of the Tribunal by a quorum.\\r\\nWhen the matter has been heard by all the three members, the award should have been given by all of them.\\r\\nTherefore the award given by two of them is not the award of the Tribunal constituted by the Government.\\r\\nIt is therefore vitiated and has to be quashed.\\r\\nReference in this connection was made to section 8 of the Act which reads as follows : \"If the services of the chairman of a Board or of the chairman or other member of a Court or Tribunal cease to be available at any time the appropriate Government shall, in the case of a chairman, and may in the case of any other member, appoint another independent person to fill the vacancy, and the proceedings shall be continued before the Board, Court or Tribunal so reconstituted.\\r\\n\" The Tribunal was never reconstituted by the Government by any notification.\\r\\nUnder section 7 a Tribunal has to be constituted in accordance with the provisions of the Act by the Government.\\r\\nThe Government having constituted a Tribunal of three persons it had power under section 8 to reconsti tute it but did not exercise that power.\\r\\nThe result there fore is that the Tribunal as originally constituted was not the Tribunal which gave the award in this reference.\\r\\nOnly two members have given the award.\\r\\nIt was said that one of the members ceased to be available and the Government was not bound to fill up that vacancy.\\r\\nThere is no material on the record to prove whether any member became unavailable and if so, when.\\r\\nBut even if a member becomes unavailable and the Government does not choose to fill up the vacancy, still the Government has to reconstitute the Tribunal by saying that 502 two members will now constitute the Tribunal.\\r\\nAn affidavit with two telegrams annexed was filed before \"us on behalf of the respondents which disclosed that Mr. Chandrasekhara Aiyar who was one of the members of the Tribunal, in Novem ber, 1949, was appointed a member of the Boundary Commission in Bengal and that the other two members sent a telegram to the Labour Ministry asking it to fill up the vacancy or to reconstitute the Tribunal.\\r\\nThe advice given by the Ministry was that they could proceed as they were and that the Gov ernment would later on, if necessary, fill up the vacancy.\\r\\nWe are not concerned whether the advice given was right or wrong.\\r\\nBut the fact remains that the Tribunal was never reconstituted and it was not denied that Mr. Chandrasekhara Aiyar is now sitting in the same Tribunal without being again nominated to it and the Tribunal is hearing the same reference under the other issues referred to it.\\r\\nMoreover, I do not see why after having heard the reference he could not give the award even if he was in Calcutta or sign the award given by the other two members.\\r\\nThe idea of three persons hearing a case and two of them deciding it is repug nant to all notions of fairness.\\r\\nIt may well have been that the opinion of the third may have influenced the other two or the decision arrived at may have been quite different.\\r\\nIt so happened in this case that two members of the Tribunal differed on an important question of law but somehow adjust ed their differences and gave a unanimous award.\\r\\nThe presence of the third in such a situation may have very vitally affected the result.\\r\\nAfter a good deal of thought I feel that it would be most dangerous for this Court to condone proceedings of this character.\\r\\nIf exceptional powers are not exercised even when a body legally constitut ed under the statute does not function according to the statute, then they defeat the very purpose of the Constitu tion.\\r\\nReference in this connection may be made to the deci sion of their Lordships of the Privy Council in Fakira vs King Emperor (1).\\r\\nIn that case section 377 (1) A.I.R. 1937 P.O. 119.\\r\\n503 of the Code of Criminal Procedure as modified and as ap plicable to Hyderabad stood as follows : \"In every case so submitted, the confirmation of the sentence or order passed by the Court of the Resident at Hyderabad shall, when such Court consists of two or more Judges, be made, passed and signed by at least two of them.\" In Fakira \\'s case the order of confirmation was only made, passed and signed by one of them, though the Court of the Resident consisted of two Judges.\\r\\nTheir Lordships held that the peremptory provisions of section 377 had not been complied with and that the sentence passed had not been validly confirmed.\\r\\nThe appeal was allowed and the case was remitted to the Court of the Resident.\\r\\nThe provisions of section 18 of the are also of a peremptory nature.\\r\\nReference may also be made to a case arising under the Bar Councils Act reported in In re An Advocate, Madras(1), where one member of the tribunal under that Act had died and had not signed the report.\\r\\nIt was held that the tribunal ceased to be properly constituted and that the report could not be considered.\\r\\nFor the reasons given above I would quash this award and direct that the Tribunal which is still functioning should readjudge item 18 of the reference and then submit its award on this point to Government.\\r\\nThe employees cannot be held responsible for the method of procedure adopted by two members of the Tribunal.\\r\\nEach party will have to bear their own costs in this Court.\\r\\nThe appeal is allowed to the extent indicated above.\\r\\nMUKHERJEA J.\\r\\nThis appeal, which has come up before us on special leave, is directed against an award made by the All India Industrial Tribunal, dated the 19th of January, 1950.\\r\\nThe Tribunal was constituted by the Central Govern ment under section 7 of the and a large number of disputes (1) A.I.R. 1942 Mad.\\r\\n504 between several Banking companies and their emiployees were referred to it for adjudication.\\r\\nAmongst these Banking companies were the Bharat Bank Limited, the appellants before us, and the disputes between them and their employ ees, who are respondents in this appeal, related inter alia to a number of cases of retrenchment and victimization which the latter alleged against the former.\\r\\nThe Tribunal held its enquiry in Delhi in respect to the cases which were connected with the Delhi Branch of the appellants and as a result of the same, made their award on 19th January, 1950, holding that 26 persons, who were employees under the appel lants, were improperly dismissed by the latter and should be reinstated.\\r\\nFurther directions were given in the award regarding the salaries and allowances that were to be paid to the dismissed employees.\\r\\nThis award was declared to be binding in terms of the provisions of sections 15 and 19 of the by the Central Government on 30th of January, 1950, and it was directed to remain in operation for a period of one year.\\r\\nIt is against this award that the present appeal has been preferred.\\r\\nOn behalf of the Indian Union which appeared as an intervener in this appeal, as also on behalf of the respond ents, a preliminary objection was taken challenging the competency of the appeal.\\r\\nThe contention put forward by Sir Alladi Krishnaswami Aiyar, who appeared for the inter vener, in substance, is that article 136 of the Indian Constitution, under which special leave was prayed for and obtained by the appellants in this case, does not contem plate or include within its scope an appeal against an award of an Industrial Tribunal which is not vested with, and cannot exercise, judicial powers, and the decision of which cannot, therefore, rank as a judicial determination.\\r\\nThe Industrial Tribunal, it is said, is an administrative body exercising quasi judicial functions and this Court cannot be called upon to exercise the powers of an appellate Court in respect to the decision of a tribunal which is really a part of the administrative machinery of the Govern ment.\\r\\n505 In reply to this objection, it has been urged by Sir Tek Chand that the Tribunal constitutedunder the is really and in substance, a Court or judicial tribunal which is invested with the power and authority to exercise judicial functions; and in any event, the language of article 136 of the Constitution is wide enough to include an appeal from the award or determination of any tribunal, be it judicial or not.\\r\\nThere are two questions which require consideration on this preliminary point.\\r\\nThe first is, whether the award or decision of an Industrial Tribunal constituted under the is a judicial decision in the proper sense of the expression or is it the pronouncement of an administrative or quasi judicial body which may exercise some of the functions of a Court of law but is really not so ? The other question turns upon the construction to be put upon article 136 of the Constitution particularly on the meaning to be given to the words \\'tribunal \\' and \\'determina tion \\' occurring therein; and the question is whether the language is wide enough to include an adjudication or award of an Industrial Tribunal.\\r\\nAs regards the first question, it is to be noticed that owing to the intricate and complex system of Government that exists in a modern State and the vast expansion of social legislation of all sorts that have taken place in England and in other countries including our own, within the last few decades, the so called administrative and quasi judicial tribunals have come to be a permanent feature of our social and political system.\\r\\nThey function as adjudicating bodies in disputes concerning a large number of economic and.\\r\\nsocial affairs.\\r\\nIn a sense they are governmental bodies appertaining to the executive and not to the judicial branch of the State, though in various matters they are armed with judicial powers analogous to those normally carried out by Courts of law.\\r\\nThe question is, what are the tests or distinguishing features, if any, which distinguish an admin istrative tribunal from a Court of law.\\r\\nOnce we are able to formulate these tests, we would be 506 in a position to determine whether a Tribunal functioning under the is or is not a judicial tribunal properly so called.\\r\\nWhether a particular function or activity is judicial or not is often a difficult question to decide.\\r\\nThe point was elaborately dealt with by Lord Sankey who delivered the judgment of the Privy Council in Shell Co. of Australia vs Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1).\\r\\nThe question raised in that case was whether the Board of Review, which was set up in 1925 under the Commonwealth Income Tax legislation, was a Court exercising judicial powers of the Commonwealth ? The High Court of Australia decided by a majority that it was an administrative and not a judicial tribunal and this majority judgment was affirmed in appeal by the Privy Council.\\r\\nLord Sankey remarked in course of his judgment that \"the decided cases show that there are Tribunals which possess many of the trappings of a Court but which, nevertheless, are not Courts in the strict sense of exercising judicial power.\\r\\nMere externals do not make a direction by an ad hoc tribunal to an administrative officer, an exercise by a Court of judicial power.\\r\\n\" The actual decision in the case rested on the ground that the Board of Review could not be a judicial tribunal, as its orders were not conclusive for any purpose whatsoev er.\\r\\nThe decision, it seems, has only a negative value.\\r\\nThe Lord Chancellor enumerated a series of negative propositions which stated inter alia that a tribunal is not necessarily a Court because two or more contending parties appear before it, nor because it hears witnesses, or gives a final deci sion which affects the right of the parties.\\r\\nWhat the real or positive test is, the Privy Council did not care to formulate, though the judgment quoted, with approval, cer tain observations of Griffith C.J. given in another Austra lian case, namely, Huddart Parker & Co. vs Moorehead(\" \\'), which to some extent neutralised the effect of the negative tests enumerated in the judgment.\\r\\nThe observations of Grif fith C.J. are as follows : (1) (2) ; , at p. 357.\\r\\n507 \"I am of opinion that the words \\'judicial power \\'. mean the power which every sovereign authority must have of necessity to decide controversies between its subjects, or between itself and its subjcets, whether the rights relate to life, liberty or property.\\r\\nThe exercise of this power does not begin until some tribunal which has power to give a binding and authoritative decision (whether subject to appeal or not) is called upon to take action.\\r\\n\" It may be stated that the authority to hear and decide on evidence between a proposal and an opposition though it is one of the most essential of judicial powers, may be present is an administrative tribunal also.\\r\\nIn the majority of cases, administrative bodies are also armed with the powers of a Court of Justice in summoning witnesses, admin istering oaths and punishing disobedience to its order made for the purpose of effecting its enquiries (1).\\r\\nAs a matter of fact, it is usual to find that those features which were at one time attached exclusively to activities carried on in a Court of law are being extended to committees, commissions or boards conducting enquiries under directions or supervi sion of the Government.\\r\\nThe presence or absence of these features, therefore, does not furnish any conclusive test to determine whether a particular body is a judicial body or not.\\r\\nIn the observations of Griffith C.J. quoted above, the learned Chief Justice laid stress on the power to make a binding and authoritative decision as the essential element in the exercise of judicial power.\\r\\nThe exact meaning and implication of these expressions were the subject matter of discussion in later Australian cases and it was held by the majority of the Judges in Rola Co. (Australia) Pty.\\r\\nLimited vs The Commonwealth (2), that t. hey do not simply mean that if an authority is given power to decide controverted ques tions of fact and its determination is made binding on the parties to the controversy, it would be sufficient to show that judicial power was entrusted to such authority.\\r\\nA determination, it was pointed out, may be binding on the parties (1) Vide W F. O \\'Connor vs Waldron at p, 82. ; 508 in the same sense as a contract is binding on them.\\r\\nWhat is necessary is that the determination by its own force and without the aid or instrumentality of any other authority or power must affect the rights and obligations of the parties; or in other words, the decision itself irrespective of the facts decided, must create rights and impose obligations; and it should be enforceable as such under the ordinary law of the land.\\r\\nThis undoubtedly is one of the fundamental tests which distinguishes a judicial body from one which exercises administrative or quasi judicial functions.\\r\\nSome times the decision or report of the administrative tribunal becomes operative after it is accepted by the head of the department under which the tribunal conducted its enquiries and it is then enforced by some sort of administrative process; or it might create rights between the parties which have to be sued upon in the ordinary way in a Court of law and it is only on the basis of a judgment or decree that is obtained in such action that relief could be had by the party.\\r\\nThe essence of judicial determination is that nothing further remains to be done except the enforcement of the judgment, a step which is compelled automatically by the law of the land.\\r\\nThe other fundamental test which distinguishes a judicial from a quasi judicial or administrative body is that the former decides controversies according to law, while the latter is not bound strictly to follow the law for its decision.\\r\\nThe investigation of facts on evidence adduced by the parties may be a common feature in both judicial and quasi judicial tribunals, but the difference between the two lies in the fact that in a judicial proceeding the Judge has got to apply to the facts found, the law of the land which is fixed and uniform.\\r\\nThe quasi judicial tribunal on the other hand gives its decision on the differences between the parties not in accordance with fixed rules of law but on principles of administrative policy or convenience or what appears to be just and proper in the circumstances of a particular case.\\r\\nIn other words, the process employed by an administrative tribunal in coming to its decision is not what is known as \\'judicial 509 process \\' (x).\\r\\nSir Maurice Gwyer in his deposition before the Committee on Minister \\'s Powers appointed by the English Parliament in 1929 stated that \"a clear distinction is to be drawn between judicial and quasijudicial powers.\\r\\n\" The \\'judicial power \\' was defined by the witness as a power to decide a question of legal right in a dispute between par ties involving either a finding of fact or the application of a fixed rule or principle of law or involving both.\\r\\n\"The quasi judicial power,\" he defined as meaning \"the power of giving decisions on questions of differences of an adminis trative and not justiciable character which cannot be deter mined by reference to any fixed law or principle of law but are matters of administrative discretion and judgment \"(2).\\r\\nIn Cooper vs Wilson (3), Scott L.J. quoted with approval and adopted as the basis of his judgment the following passage from the report of the above committee: \"A true judicial decision presupposes an existing dis pute between two or more parties, and then involves four requisites : (1) The presentation (not necessarily orally) of their case by the parties to the dispute; (2) if the dispute between them is a question of fact, the ascertain ment of the fact by means of evidence adduced by the parties to the dispute and often with the assistance of argument by or on behalf of the parties on the evidence; (3) if the dispute between them is a question of law, the submission of legal argument by the parties; and (4) a decision which disposes of the whole matter by a finding upon the facts in dispute and an application of the law of the land to the facts so found, including where required a ruling upon any disputed question of law.\\r\\nA quasi judicial decision equally presupposes an existing dispute between two or more parties and involves (1) and (2) but does not necessarily involve (3) and never involves (4).\\r\\nThe place of (4) is in fact taken by administrative action, the character of which is determined by the Minister \\'s free choice.\\r\\n\" (1) See Robson \\'s Justice and Administrative Law, p. 74.\\r\\n(2) Vide Committee of Minister \\'s Powers, Minutes of Evd., Vol.\\r\\nII, pages 15 16 and also Robson \\'s Justice and Adminis trative Law, p. 319.\\r\\n(3) 510 In our opinion these statements correctly bring out the distinction between a judicial tribunal and an administra tive body which exercises quasi judicial functions.\\r\\nThese being the essential features which distinguish the two classes of tribunals, we would have to ascertain with refer ence to the provisions of the , which class or category of tribunals an Industrial Tribunal comes under.\\r\\nThe object of the , as set out in the preamble, is \"to make provisions for investigation and settlement of industrial disputes and for certain other purposes hereinafter appearing.\\r\\n\" The word \"settlement\" suggests the idea of establishing compromise between the interests of disputing parties.\\r\\nThere are three classes \\'of authorities provided for by the Act who are entrusted with the powers and duties of investigation and settlement of industrial disputes.\\r\\nFirst of all, there are conciliation officers or Boards of Concil iation, whose duties mainly are to induce parties to come to a fair and amicable settlement amongst themselves.\\r\\nSecond ly, there are Courts of Enquiry and though they are \\' de scribed as Courts, their duties end with investigation into the matters referred to them and submitting reports there upon to the appropriate Government.\\r\\nLastly, there are Industrial Tribunals composed of independent persons who either are or had been Judges of a High Court or District Judges or are qualified for appointment as High Court Judges.\\r\\nIt will be seen from the descriptions given above that the Board of Conciliation or Court of Enquiry constituted under the could, on no account, be regarded as judicial tribunals.\\r\\nTo enable them to investi gate facts they are however armed with certain powers of compelling attendance of witnesses and production of docu ments etc.\\r\\nThese provisions are to be found in section 11 of the Act.\\r\\nThe significant thing to note is, that there is no distinction made in this respect between Conciliation Boards and Courts of Enquiry on the One hand and Industrial Tribunals on the other.\\r\\nThe same powers are conferred 511 the three classes of authorities without any distinction whatsoever and sub section (3) of section 11 further lays down that any enquiry or investigation by a Board, Court of Enquiry or Tribunal shall be deemed to be a judicial pro ceeding within the meaning of sections 193 and 228 of the Indian Penal Code.\\r\\nThis means that proceedings before an Industrial Tribunal or for the matter of that before the other two bodies also could be deemed to \\'be judicial pro ceedings only for certain specified purposes.\\r\\nThe express provision making the proceedings judicial proceedings for those purposes only emphasises that they are not judicial proceedings otherwise.\\r\\nUnder section 15 (1), the Industrial Tribunal has got to submit its award to the appropriate Government and sub section (2) lays down that on receipt of such an award, the appropriate Government shall by order in writing declare the award to be binding.\\r\\nA different provision has been made in regard to cases where the Government itself figures as a party to the dispute.\\r\\nIn such cases, if the Government considers it inexpedient on public grounds to give effect to the award either in whole or in part, it may, at the earli est opportunity, lay the award for consideration before the Provincial or Central Legislative Assembly as the case may be and the Legislative Assembly may.\\r\\nby its resolution confirm, modify or reject the award.\\r\\nAfter the resolution is passed, the Government is to declare the award so con firmed or modified to be binding [see sub section (3)].\\r\\nSub section (4) of section 15 expressly lays down that an award declared to be binding under any two of the previous sub sections shall not be called into question in any manner whatsoever.\\r\\nThe Government is not merely to declare the award binding but under section 19 (3), it has got to speci fy the date when the award would come into force and also to fix the period during which it would remain binding, and this period shall not exceed one year.\\r\\nIt will be seen, therefore, that there is nothing in the from which it could be inferred that the Industrial Tribunal really functions as a Court exercis ing judicial functions.\\r\\nRegarding 512 the trappings or the external indicia of a Court, its i position is almost the same as that of the Board of Con ciliation or Court of Enquiry and Bakshi Sir Tek Chand concedes that the latter are not judicial tribunals at all.\\r\\nThe powers of an Industrial Tribunal are certainly wider than those of the other bodies, but it has no power to make a final pronouncement which would proprio vigore be binding on, and create rights and obligations between the parties.\\r\\nIt is for the appropriate Government to declare the award to be binding and the part which the Government plays in such matters is not a mechanical part merely, for the award can really become operative only when the date of its commence ment and the period of its duration are fixed, and it is for the Government and Government alone to.\\r\\nfix the same.\\r\\nWith regard to the other class of cases, where the Government itself is one of the parties to the dispute, the position is still worse.\\r\\nAn award in such cases is always subject to the contingency of being rejected or modified by the legis lature before whom it could be placed for consideration at the option of the Government.\\r\\nWhere a contingency like this is attached to an award, it can never be regarded as a final or binding decision which is of the essence of a judicial proceeding.\\r\\nThe fact that in cases of disputes between private employers and their workmen, the Government has to accept the award as it is, makes no difference in principle.\\r\\nPossibly, this rule was made in consideration of the status and training of the people who constitute the Tribunal, but nevertheless the determination cannot acquire any authority or force, so long as the appropriate Government does not make the declaration and fix the time of its operation as mentioned above.\\r\\nIn regard to the other class of awards, where the Government is one of the disput ing parties, the award on the face of it is neither the final nor the authoritative pronouncement on the matter in dispute, and it is always in the powers.\\r\\nof one of the disputing parties to subject it to further scrutiny at the hands of the legislature who can reject the whole award or effect such changes in it as it considers proper.\\r\\nThis shows the real nature of the Tribunal and it is not and 513 could not be suggested that the Industrial Tribunal is a Tribunal which exercises judicial functions when the dispute is only between private employers and their workmen, and it ceases to be such when the employer is the Government it self.\\r\\nWe would now examine the process by which an Industrial Tribunal comes to its decisions and I have no hesitation in holding that the process employed is not judicial process at all.\\r\\nIn settling the disputes between the employers and the workmen, the function of the Tribunal is not confined to administration of justice in accordance with law.\\r\\nIt can confer rights and privileges on either party which it con siders reasonable and proper, though they may not be within the terms of any existing agreement.\\r\\nIt has not merely to interpret or give effect to the contractual rights and obligations of the parties.\\r\\nIt can create new rights and obligations between them which it considers essential for keeping industrial peace.\\r\\nAn industrial dispate as has been said on many occasions is nothing but a trial of strength between the employers on the one hand and the workmen \\'s organization on the other and the Industrial Tribunal has got to arrive at some equitable arrangement for averting strikes and lock outs which impede production of goods and the industrial development of the country.\\r\\nThe Tribunal is not bound by the rigid rules of law.\\r\\nThe process it employs is rather an extended form of the process of collective bargaining and is more akin to administrative than to judi cial function.\\r\\nIn describing the true position of an Industrial Tribu nal in dealing with labour disputes, this Court in Western India Automobile Association vs Industrial Tribunal, Bom bay, and others(1) quoted with approval a passage from Ludwig Teller \\'s well known work on the subject, where the learned author observes that \"industrial arbitration may involve the extension of ,existing agreement or the making of a new one or in general the creation of new obligations or modification of old ones, while commercial arbitration generally (1) at p. 345.\\r\\n514 concerns itself with interpretation of existing obligations and disputes relating to existing agreements.\\r\\n\" The views expressed in these observations were adopted in its entire ty by this Court.\\r\\nOur conclusion, therefore, is that an Industrial Tribunal formed under the is not a judicial tribunal and its determination is not a judicial determination in the proper sense of these expres sions.\\r\\nWe now come to the other question as to whether an appeal could be taken to this Court against an award of an Industrial Tribunal by special leave under article 136 of the Constitution.\\r\\nArticle 136 is a part of Chapter IV of the Constitution which deals with the Union Judiciary.\\r\\nThe different jurisdictions of the Supreme Court have been prescribed in a series of articles commencing from article 131.\\r\\nArticle 131 defines the original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court.\\r\\nArticle 132 deals with its appellate powers in cases where substantial questions of law as to the inter pretation of the Constitution are involved.\\r\\nArticle 133 contains the provision relating to appeals in civil cases from judgments, decrees and orders of the High Courts;and article 134 makes provisions relating to criminal appeals.\\r\\nArticle 135 lays down that the Supreme Court shall have jurisdiction and powers with respect to any matter not covered by articles 133 and 134, if such jurisdiction and power could have been exercised by the Federal Court prior to the coming into force of the present Constitution.\\r\\nThen comes article 136 which runs as follows: \"(1) Notwithstanding anything in this Chapter, the Supreme Court may, in its discretion, grant special leave to appeal from any judgment, decree, determination, sentence or order in any cause or matter passed or made by any court or tribunal in the territory of India.\\r\\n\" The article is worded in the widest terms possible.\\r\\nIt vests in the Supreme Court a plenary jurisdiction in the matter of entertaining and hearing appeals by granting of special leave against any kind of judgment, decree or order made by any Court or tribunal in any 515 cause or matter and the powers could be exercised in spite of and overriding the specific provisions for appeal con tained in the previous articles.\\r\\nThe controversy so far as the present case is concerned mainly centers round the interpretation to be put upon two words, namely, \"determi nation\" and \"tribunal\" used in the article.\\r\\nDoes the word \"tribunal\" mean a judicial tribunal only and is the expres sion \"determination\" restricted to what is known as \"judi cial determination\"? Sir Alladi \\'s contention is that in interpreting these words we should follow the principle of ejusdent generis.\\r\\n\"Determination,\" he says, must be taken to be judicial determination which is of the same nature as decree, judg ment, order or sentence; and \"tribunal\" associated with the word\" Court\" could not but mean \"judicial tribunal.\\r\\n\" Bakshi Sir Tek Chand on the other hand lays stress on the fact that the word \"determination\" was not in the origi nal draft Constitution, and it was subsequently added, presumably with a view to widen the scope of article 136 and include within it, the decisions of administrative and quasi judicial tribunals also.\\r\\nHe points out that according to the definition given in section 2 (b) of the , \"award\" means a determination either interim or final of an industrial dispute by an Industrial Tribunal.\\r\\nThere is undoubtedly something to be said in favour of both these views.\\r\\nThe difficulty, in our opinion, arises from the fact that neither of these terms \"determination\" or \"tribunal\" has a fixed or definite connotation in ordinary language.\\r\\nThe word \"determination\" means and signifies the ending of a controversy or litigation by the decision of a Judge or Arbitrator.\\r\\nIt cannot be said that it is restrict ed exclusively to proceedings in court.\\r\\nLikewise, the dictionary meaning of the word \"tribunal\" is \\'court of justice \\' or \\'seat of a Judge. \\' By \\'Judge \\' we mean some authority by which contested matters are decided between rival parties.\\r\\nHere again, it is not possible to say that the expression is applicable only to a 66 516 regular court of law.\\r\\nIf the tribunal is a full fledged judicial tribunal, it is not disputed that its decisions would be proper subject matter of appeal under article ,136 of the Constitution.\\r\\nThe question is whether this article includes within its scope the determinations of quasi judicial tribunals as well.\\r\\nOur view is that ordinarily we should not put any re stricted interpretation upon the plain words of an article in the Constitution and thereby limit our powers of granting special leave for appeals, which the Constitution for best of reasons did not choose to fetter or circumscribe in any way.\\r\\nAt the same time, we must admit that some sort of restricted interpretation may be unavoidable in view of the context in which particular words appear; and certain re strictions may be implicit in the very purpose for which article 136 has been framed.\\r\\nArticle 136 empowers us in our discretion to hear appeals from pronouncements of all infe rior courts and tribunals.\\r\\nWith regard to law courts, no difficulty arises.\\r\\nAs regards tribunals which are not courts in the proper sense of the expression, it may not be proper, in our opinion, to lay down a hard and fast rule that no appeals could, on any account, be allowed against determina tions of such tribunals.\\r\\nThere are numerous varieties of these adjudicating bodies, whose structures vary greatly in character and composition and so do the powers and functions which they exercise.\\r\\nThe best thing to do would be to examine each type of cases as it arises and if we find that with regard to determinations emanating from certain tribu nals it is not possible for us to exercise fully and effec tively the powers of an appellate Court, such determinations must be held to lie outside the purview of article 136 of the Constitution.\\r\\nThis disability in the matter of exercising our powers as an appellate Court might arise from the fact that the rules and principles by which we ordinarily judge the sound ness or otherwise of judicial decisions are not capable of being applied to the determinations of certain administra tive tribunals.\\r\\nIt might also arise from the fact that the law under which the 517 tribunal functions prevents us from making any effective order which would be binding and operative of its own force without the intervention of some other power or authority; or there may be some kind of contingency attached to it.\\r\\nIn our opinion, these difficulties do confront us in the entertaining or hearing of an appeal against the decision of an Industrial Tribunal.\\r\\nIn the first place, as we have said above, the determination of an Industrial Tribunal does not become complete and binding unless and until it is declared to be so by the appropriate Government.\\r\\nTill the Government makes such declaration, neither of the parties to the dis pute can have any real reason for filing an appeal.\\r\\nAn appeal, if it lies, could be filed after the determination has been declared binding.\\r\\nBut in such cases, is it the determination of the Tribunal merely which is challenged by way of appeal or is it \\' the determination by the Tribunal to which has been super added a declaration by the Government ? The decision in the appeal would undoubtedly affect not merely the decision of the Tribunal but that of the Govern ment as well which is certainly not a tribunal within the meaning of article 136.\\r\\nAssuming again that the award is set aside and we substitute our own determination in place of the award given by the Tribunal, will our award be enforce able by itself or will it require a declaration by the Government to make it binding ? If Government is itself a party to the dispute, will it be open to Government to place our decision for consideration by the Legislative Assembly? And will the Legislative Assembly be competent to reject or modify our award ? These problems arise because under sec tion 15 the award under the Act becomes binding only when the Government declares it to be so and if our judgment takes the place of the award of the Tribunal, all the in firmities that attach to the award must necessarily attach to our judgment also.\\r\\nThe other difficulty is no less formidable.\\r\\nAs said above, the Tribunal is not bound to decide the disputes by application of the ordinary law of the land.\\r\\nA good deal depends upon questions of policy 518 and public convenience.\\r\\nIt is not possible for us to.judge the propriety of the decision by a reference to some stand ard or fixed rules and we think that the very policy of the law prevents us from interfering with the discretion exer cised by the Tribunal.\\r\\nWhere the direction is committed to any body or a tribunal exercising quasi judicial functions which are not lettered by ordinary rules of law, the tribunal should in the absense of any provision to the contrary be deemed to have the final authority in the exercise of that discretion.\\r\\nWe cannot sit in appeal over their decision and substitute our own discre tion for theirs.\\r\\n,Questions, however, may and do arise where such quasi judicial body attempts to usurp jurisdiction which it does not possess.\\r\\nIt may assume jurisdiction under a mistaken view of law or refuse to exercise jurisdiction properly by adoption of extraneous or irrelevant considera tions;or there may be cases where in its proceedings the tribunal violates the principles of natural justice.\\r\\nIn all such cases the most proper and adequate remedy would be by writs of certiorari or prohibition and the Court having authority may direct that the decision of the body or tribu nal might be brought up to be quashed for lack of jurisdic tion or for mistake apparent on the face of it; and if the proceedings had not terminated at that time, a writ of prohibition may also be issued for preventing the tribunal from exceeding its jurisdiction.\\r\\nThe issuing of such writs would not be an exercise of appellate powers which means the rehearing of the case and passing of such judgment which in the opinion of the appellate Court the original tribunal should have made.\\r\\nThe object of these writs is simply to keep the exercise of powers by these quasi judicial tribu nals within the limits of jurisdiction assigned to them by law and torestrain them from acting in excess of their authority.\\r\\nThese principles are well settled and require no elucidation(1).\\r\\nOur conclusion, therefore, is that article 136 of the Constitution does not contemplate a determination given by the Industrial Tribunal.\\r\\n(1) Rex vs Electricity Commissioners ; Board of Education vs Rice 519 Even assuming for argument \\'s sake that we have got jurisdiction under article 136, the exercise of which would depend upon the circumstances of each case, in view of the reasons which we have set out above, this is not an appeal which, in our opinion, should be admitted even if we have the power to do so.\\r\\nThe result is that the preliminary objection succeeds and the appeal fails and is dismissed with costs.\\r\\nPATANJALI SASTRI \\' J.\\r\\nI entirely agree with the judgment just now delivered by Mukherjea J. and I have nothing to add.\\r\\nAppeal dismissed.\\r\\nAgent for the Union of India: P.A.

Setalvad, Attorney General for India, (G. N. Joshi, with him) for respondent No. 3 (the State of Bombay.) 1952.\\r\\nJanuary 30.\\r\\nJudgment was delivered by BOSE J. PATANJALI SASTRI C.J. and DAS J. agreed with Bose J. Bose J.\\r\\nThe plaintiff appeals.\\r\\nThe suit relates to a Saranjam estate in the State of Bombay.\\r\\nThe plaintiff claims to be the sole Saranjamdar and seeks certain declarations and other reliefs appropriate to such a claim.\\r\\nThe first and second defendants are members of the plaintiff \\'s family while the third defendant is the State of Bombay (Province of Bombay at the date of the suit).\\r\\nThe only question is whether the suit is barred by section 4 (a) of Bombay Act X of 1876 (Bombay Revenue Juris diction Act).\\r\\nThe following genealogical tree will show the relation ship between the parties: Bhujangrao Appasaheb (British grantee) Daulatrao I (died 24 7 1864) Bhujangrao I Malojirao Yeshwantrao alias (died 1881 ) : Annasaheb : : : (widow) Krishnabai Daulatrao III Bhujangrao II Daulatrao II (Del. 1) (Def. 2) (died 8 5 1931) : Bhujangrao III (Plaintiff) 405 The facts are as follows.\\r\\nA common ancestor of the present parties was given the Gajendragad estate as a Saran jam some time before the advent of the British.\\r\\nWhen they arrived on the scene they decided, as far as possible, to continue such Saranjams, jagirs and inams as had been grant ed by the earlier rulers, and accordingly they framed rules under Schedule B, Rule 10 of Bombay Act XI of 1852 (The Bombay Rent Free Estates Act of 1852) to regulate the mode of recognition and the succession and conditions of tenure to Saranjams, which are analogous to jagirs.\\r\\nIn compliance with this, the common ancestor shown at the head of the genealogical tree set out above was recognised by the Brit ish Government as the Saranjamdar of the Gajendragad estate.\\r\\nHe may for convenience be termed the British Grantee.\\r\\nThe Register exhibit P 53 shows that the estate consisted of 26 villages.\\r\\nWe do not know the date of the British recognition but the nature of the tenure is described as follows : \"Continuable to all male legitimate descendants of the holder at the time of British conquest, viz., Bhujangrao Appasaheb, the first British Grantee, son of Bahirojirao Ghorpade.\\r\\n\" On the death of the British Grantee (Bhujangrao Appa saheb) he was succeeded by his son Daulatrao I who died on the 24th of July, 1864.\\r\\nThis Daulatrao I left three sons, Bhujangrao I, Yeshwantrao and Malojirao.\\r\\nIn the year 1866 Bhujangrao I and his brother Yesh wantrao alias Annasaheb sued Malojirao for possession of this Saranjam.\\r\\nA question of impartibility was raised but the Bombay High Court declared that the property in British India was partible.\\r\\nThey further declared that Bhujangrao I was the head of the family and as such was entitled to a special assignment which was not to exceed a quarter share, for the expenses and duties which might devolve on him by virtue of his position, and that after this had been set aside each of the three brothers was entitled to an equal one third Share in the landed property in India.\\r\\nThis judgment 406 is reported in The duties enumerated at page 170 included the \"keeping up of armed retainers for the fort of Gajendragad, and for the improvement of that vil lage, which was the chief seat of this branch of the Ghor pade family, and also to enable him to distribute on ceremo nial occasions the customary presents to the junior members of the family.\\r\\n\" The judgment is dated the 12th of October, 1868.\\r\\nAs a consequence a division of the property was ef fected.\\r\\nMalojirao separated himself from his brothers and was allotted seven villages.\\r\\nThe other two brothers continued joint and took the remainder.\\r\\nBut this was only with respect to property situate in British India.\\r\\nThe parties also had property in the State of Kolhapur.\\r\\nThat was left undivided.\\r\\nBhujangrao I died in 1881 and his younger brother Yesh wantrao (alias Annasaheb) claimed to succeed as the sole heir.\\r\\nThe Political Department of the Government of India refused to recognise this claim and permitted Bhujangrao I \\'s widow Krishnabai to adopt a a boy from the family and recog nised him as the heir in respect of that portion of the estate which lay within the Principality of Kolhapur.\\r\\nThis was on the 3rd of February, 1882.\\r\\nThe Bombay Government followed a similar course regarding the property in British India.\\r\\nOn the 26th of April, 1882, they passed a Resolution embodying the follow ing decision: (1) The adoption was to be recognised and the adopted son was to occupy the same position as his adoptive father, that is to say, he was to get one third of the property plus the assignment given to him as head of the family.\\r\\n(2) Malojirao who had already taken his share of the estate was to continue in possession.\\r\\n(3) Yeshwantrao (alias Annasaheb) was given the option of remaining joint with the adopted boy or separating.\\r\\nFinally, the Resolution Concluded 407 ``The two brothers will hold their respective shares as their private property in virtue of the decree of the High Court and the Jahagir will henceforth be restricted to the portion awarded by the High Court to Bhujangrao which the adopted son will now inherit.\\r\\nIt should however be clearly understood that the decision of the High Court is not to be held as a precedent and that no partition of the Jahagir Estate to be continued to the adopted son will ever be allowed.\\r\\n\" This position was emphasised by Government in the same year on the 22nd August, 1882.\\r\\nKrishnabai, who had been allowed by Government to adopt Daulatrao II, asked that her husband \\'s one third share in the estate be also treated as private property in the same way as the shares of the other two brothers.\\r\\nThis prayer was refused and Government stat ed: \"It should be plainly understood that Government allow the adoption to be made by her only in consideration of Bhujangrao \\'s one third share as well as the portion assigned to him as head of the family being continued to the adopted son as indivisible Jahagir Estate descending in the line of male heirs in the order of primogeniture and subject to no terms whatsoever as to the enjoyment of the same by Krishna bai during her lifetime.\\r\\n\" The position was re examined by Government in 1891 and its decision was embodied in the following resolution dated the 17th of March, 1891: \"It appears to Government that the whole Gajendragad Estate is a Saranjam continuable as hereditary in the full est sense of the word as interpreted by the Court of Direc tors in paragraph 9 of their Despatch No. 27 dated 12th December, 1855.\\r\\nIt is continuable to all male legitimate descendants of the holder at the time of the British con quest; and should Government ever sanction an adoption the terms of sanction would be those applicable to Saranjamdars.\\r\\nThe property should be dealt with like Other Saranjams in the Political Department.\\r\\n\" 53 408 In the year 1901 the adopted son Daulatrao II sued Yeshwantrao \\'s son Bhujangrao II for partition.\\r\\nIt will be remembered that in the litigation of 1866, which ended in the Bombay High Court \\'s judgment reported in 5 Bom.\\r\\nH.C.R. 161, Malojirao alone separated and the other two brothers continued joint.\\r\\nThe litigation of 1901 put an end to that position.\\r\\nHigh Court \\'s judgment dated the 12th of March, 1908, makes it clear that as Government was not a party to that litigation its rights against either or both of the parties were not affected.\\r\\nBut as between the parties inter se they were bound by the previous decision and so the adopted son was entitled to partition and separate posses sion of such properties as might fall to his share.\\r\\nAfter this decision was given the two partitioned the property between themselves amicably.\\r\\nIn or about the year 1930 a Record of Rights was intro duced in fourteen of the villages in the Gajendragad Jaha gir and a dispute arose again between the three branches of the family.\\r\\nThe District Deputy Collector, after inspecting the records, found that \"the name of the Khatedar Saran jamdar alone has found place in the village Inam register, in the Saranjam list and the land alienation register,\" while in the other village records the various members of the family were entered according to the \"actual wahivat or enjoyment.\" After due consideration he thought that the interest of Government and the Saranjamdar would be sufficiently safeguarded by allowing the same position to continue.\\r\\nHe ordered the entries to be made accordingly.\\r\\nThe order also discloses that the matter had been referred to the Legal Remembrancer to the Bombay Government.\\r\\nIn the meanwhile, on the 5th of May, 1898, a set of Rules framed under Schedule B, Rule 10, of the Bombay Rent Free Estates Act of 1852 were drawn up and published in the Bombay Gazette.\\r\\nThese Rules were republished, probably with some modification, in the Gazette of 8th July, 1901.\\r\\nThe portions applicable here were as follows: 409 \"I. Saranjams shall ordinarily be continued in accordance with the decision already passed by Government in each case.\\r\\nA Saranjam which has been decided to be hereditarily continuable shall ordinarily descend to the eldest male representative, in the order of primogeniture, of the senior branch of the family descended from the first British Gran tee or any of his brothers who were undivided in interest.\\r\\nBut Government reserve to themselves their rights for suffi cient reason to direct the continuance of the Saranjam to any other member of the said family, or as an act of grace, to a person adopted into the same family with the sanction of Government.\\r\\nV. Every Saranjam shall be held as a life estate.\\r\\nIt shall be formally resumed on the death of the holder and in cases in which it is capable of further continuance it shall be made over to the next holder as a fresh grant from Gov ernment, unencumbered by any debts, or charges, save such as may be specially imposed by Government itself.\\r\\nNo Saranjam shall be capable of sub division.\\r\\nEvery Saranjamdar shall be responsible for making a suitable provision for the maintenance of. \"(certain members of the family enumerated in the Rule).\\r\\nIf an order passed by Government under Rule VII is not carried out, Government may, whatever the reason may be, direct the Saranjam, or a portion of it, to be resumed. .\\r\\nProvision for the members of the Saranjam dar \\'s family entitled to maintenance shall then be made by Government out of the revenues of the Saranjam so resumed.\\r\\n\" After the District Deputy Collector \\'s orders were passed on the 20th of May, 1930, Daulatrao II died on the 8th of May, 1931, and the matter was again taken up by Government.\\r\\nThis time it passed the following 410 Resolution on the 7th of June, 1932.\\r\\nThe Resolution was headed, \"Resumption and regrant of the Gajendragad Saranjam standing at No. 91 of the Saranjam List.\\r\\n\" It reads \"Resolution : The Governor in Council is pleased to direct that the Gajendragad Saranjam should be formally resumed and regranted to Bhujangrao Daulatrao Ghorpade eldest son of the deceased Saranjamdar Sardar Daulatrao Bhujangrao Ghorpade and that it should be entered in his sole name in the accounts of the Collector of Dharwar with effect from the date of the death of the last holder.\\r\\nThe Collector should take steps to place the Saranjamdar in possession of the villages of the Saranjam estate which were in possession of the deceased Saranjamdar.\\r\\nThe Governor in Council agrees with the Commis sioner, Southern Division, that the assignments held by the Bhaubands as potgi holders should be continued to them as at present.\\r\\n\" The Bhujangrao mentioned in the Resolution is the plain tiff who is shown as Bhujangrao III in the genealogical tree.\\r\\nThe defendants were evidently aggrieved by this, for they filed Suit No. 23 of 1934 against the present plaintiff and the Secretary of State/or India in Council praying inter alia \"that the properties in that suit, viz., the villages allotted to their shares, were their independent and private properties and in case they were held to be Saranjam proper ties, they be declared as independent Saranjams, separate and distinct from the one held by the present plaintiff.\\r\\n\" This suit was withdrawn with liberty to bring a fresh suit on the same cause of action against the present plain tiff but not against the Secretary of State for India in Council.\\r\\nAccording to defendants 1 and 2, this was pursuant to an arrangement between the Government and themselves that Government would issue a fresh Resolution in terms of the earlier Resolution dated the 17th of March, 1891.\\r\\n411 This was done.\\r\\nOn the 25th of February, 1936, Government passed the following Resolution : \"Resolution : After careful consideration the Governor in Council is pleased to confirm the decision in Government Resolution (Political Department) No. 1769 dated the 17th of March, 1891,and to declare that the whole of the Gajendragad Estate shall be continuable as an inalienable and impartible Saranjam on the conditions stated in the said Resolution.\\r\\nHaving regard, however, to the manner in which different portions of the estate have been held by different branches of the family, the Governor in Council, in modification of the orders contained in Government Resolution No. 8969 dated the 7th June, 1932, is pleased to direct that the portions of the said estate held by Sardar Bhujangrao Daulatrao Ghorpade, Daulatrao Malojirao Ghorpade and Bhujangrao Yeshwantrao Ghorpade, respectively, shall henceforth be entered in the Revenue Records as de facto shares in the said estate held by the said persons as representatives, respectively, of three branches of the Ghorpade family.\\r\\nEach of the said de facto shares shall be continuable hereditarily as such as ii it were a separate Saranjam estate in accordance with the rules made for the continuance of Saranjams by the Governor in Council in exercise of the powers referred to in the rules framed under the Bombay Rent Free Estates Act, 1852, and section 2 (3) of the Bombay Summary Settlement Act (VII of 1863) and such special orders as the Governor in Council may make in regard to the Gajendragad Estate as a whole or in regard to the said share.\\r\\nThe recognition of the aforesaid shares and their entry in the Revenue Records as separate shares shall not be deemed to amount to a recognition of the estate of Gajendragad as in any manner partible or alienable and shall not in any way affect the right of Government to treat the said estate as an entire impartible and inalien able Saranjam estate.\\r\\nThe Governor in Council further directs that the aforesaid shares shall in no case be capable of 412 sub division and shall not in any way be alienated or encum bered except in accordance with the rules and orders re ferred to above. \" The present suit is an attack on the action of Govern ment in passing this Resolution.\\r\\nThe first and second defendants are the present representatives of the other branches of the family and the third defendant is the Prov ince of Bombay (now the State of Bombay).\\r\\nThe plaint states \"9.\\r\\nGovernment can have no jurisdiction to deprive the plaintiff at any rate during his lifetime of the full bene fit of all the rights and privileges appertaining to the holder of a Saranjam.\\r\\nThe Order of Government of the 8th February, 1936 is, therefore, ultra vires and in no way binding on the present plaintiff. 10.\\r\\nDefendants 1 and 2, therefore, are not entitled to any rights or privileges claimable by the holder of a Saran jam which according to the G.R. is continuable \\'as an inali enable and impartible Saranjam \\', such as for example in the matter of appointment of the village officers in any of the 27 villages appertaining to the Gajendragad Saranjam.\\r\\nThe cause of action arose in April 1938 and the resolution and the entry being ultra vires is not binding. 12.\\r\\nAs this is a suit claiming for relief primarily against defendants 1 and 2, defendant 3 is made a party to the suit in order to enable Government (defendant 3) to give proper effect to the decision of Government of the 17th March, 1891, and of 7th June, 1932, as against defendants 1 and 2 who have no right to the position which they claim. \" The reliefs prayed for are \"(a) That it be declared that defendants 1 and 2 have no right to go behind the order of the Government as per Reso lution No. 8969 of 7th June, 1932, under which plaintiff is entitled to be recognised as the sole Saranjamdar in the Revenue Records, and that the assignments held by defendants 1 and 2 are held by them as mere potgi holders.\\r\\n413 (b) That in consequence of his position of a sole Saran jamdar the plaintiff alone at any rate during his lifetime has the sole right to the rights and privileges appertaining to the post of a sole Saranjamdar, to wit, to be consulted in the appointment of the village officers in all the villages appertaining to the Saranjam estate, but assigned to defendants 1 and 2 for potgi. (c) Defendants 1 and 2 be restrained from doing any acts or taking any steps in contravention of the aforesaid right of the plaintiff.\\r\\n(d) That it be declared that defendant 3 (Government) have no right to change the Resolution No. 8969 of 7th June, 1932, and at any rate during the lifetime of the plaintiff.\\r\\n\" The first Court dismissed the plaintiff \\'s claim on the merits holding that Government had the right to amend its Resolution in the way it did.\\r\\nThe lower appellate Court also dismissed the suit on three grounds: (1) that the two previous decisions of 1868 and 1908 operate as res judicata, (2) that the impugned Resolution is intra vires and (3) that section 4 (a) and (d) of the Revenue Jurisdiction Act bars the jurisdiction of the Court.\\r\\nIn second appeal the High Court only considered the question of jurisdiction and, agreeing with the lower appel late Court on the point, dismissed the appeal but it granted the plaintiff leave to appeal to this Court.\\r\\nThe only question we have to consider is the one of jurisdiction.\\r\\nSection 4 of the Bombay Revenue Jurisdiction Act, 1876 (Bombay Act X of 1876), runs Subject to the exceptions hereinafter appearing, no Civil Court shall exercise jurisdiction as to (a). claims against the Crown relating to lands. held as Saranjam. \" It was strenuously contended that this is not a claim against the Crown but one against the first and second defendants.\\r\\nThat, in my opinion, is an idle contention in view of paragraphs 9 and 12 of the plaint and reliefs (a)and (d).\\r\\nIn any event, Mr. Somayya was asked whether he would strike out the third defendant 414 and those portions of the plaint which sought relief against it.\\r\\nHe said he was not prepared to do so.\\r\\nI cannot see how a plaintiff can insist on retaining a person against whom he claims no relief as a party.\\r\\nI am clear that this is a suit against the \"Crown\" within the meaning of section 4(a).\\r\\nThe next question is whether, assuming that to be the case, it is also one \"relating to lands held as Saranjam.\\r\\n\" So far as the reliefs sought against Government are concerned, that is clearly the case.\\r\\nParagraph 9 of the plaint challenges Government \\'s jurisdiction to deprive the plaintiff of the full benefit of all rights and privileges appertaining to the holder of a Saranjam.\\r\\nThese rights cannot exist apart from the lands which form part of the Saranjam estate and the implication of the prayer is that Government has, for example, no right to resume the Saranjam either under Rule V on the death of the last Saran jamdar or under Rule IX during his lifetime.\\r\\nIt is to be observed that a resumption under Rule IX can only be of the land because the rule directs that when the Saranjam is resumed Government itself shall make provisions for the maintenance of those entitled to it \"out of the revenues of the Saranjam so resumed.\\r\\n\" These revenues can only come out of the land.\\r\\nRelief (d) in the prayer clause seeks a declaration that Government has no right to change Resolution No. 8969 dated the 7th of June, 1932.\\r\\nThat Resolution directly relates to the land because it directs that the Gajendragad Saranjam be resumed and the Collector is directed to take steps to place the Saranjamdar in possession of the villages of the Saran jam estate etc.\\r\\nIt is impossible to contend that this is not a claim relating to lands held as Saranjam.\\r\\nIt was next argued that if that be the case the claim against Government can be dismissed and the plaintiff can at least be given the reliefs claimed against the other two defendants.\\r\\nThese, it was contended, do not relate to land and in any event are not claims against the \"Crown\".\\r\\n415 In my opinion, this is not a suit in which the rights claimed against the other defendants can be divorced from the claim against Government and considered separately.\\r\\nThat is evident enough from paragraph 10 of the plaint.\\r\\nIn para graph 9 the power of Government to deprive the plaintiff of the rights he claims is challenged and in paragraph 10 the plaintiff explains that \"therefore\" the first and second defendants are not entitled to any of the rights and privileges of the Saranjamdar.\\r\\nOne of those rights, as we have seen from Rules VII and IX, is to take the revenues of the entire estate in order that he might fulfil his obligation regarding the payment of maintenance to certain members of the family; and if the defendants claim to hold their lands under the orders of Government and the plaintiff insists on retaining Government as a party in order that it may be bound by the decree he wants against the other defendants it is obvious that his claim against these defendants cannot be separated from his claim against the Government.\\r\\nIn any event, if the claim against Government is to be ignored it can only be on the basis that its orders cannot be challenged and if the orders stand it is evident that the plaintiff can have no hope of success because both sides hold their respective properties on the basis of those orders.\\r\\nThere are two decisions of the Bombay High Court which have taken this view.\\r\\nBasalingappagouda vs The Secretary of State for India(1) was a Watan case.\\r\\nGovernment had recog nised the second defendant as the Watandar.\\r\\nPlaintiff sued Government and the second defendant and sought a declaration and injunction.\\r\\nOn being faced with the dilemma that the suit against Government did not lie because of section 4 (a) (3) of the Bombay Revenue Jurisdiction Act of 1876, he asked the Court, as here, to leave the Government out of consider ation and decree his claim against the second defendant alone.\\r\\nThe learned Judges held that that would amount to striking out the main relief sought against both the defend ants and would entirely (1) 28 Born.\\r\\nL.R. 651.\\r\\n54 416 change the character of the suit and added that \"as long as the Secretary of State is a party to the suit, such a decla ration could not be granted.\\r\\n\" In the other case, Basangauda vs The Secretary State(1), Beaumont C.J. and Baker J. took the same view.\\r\\nThey said \"Mr. Gumaste, who appears for the appellant, says that his claim is not a claim against the Government but in that case he ought to strike out the Government.\\r\\nHe is not pre pared to strike out the Government, because if he does they will not be bound by these proceedings and will follow the decision of their revenue tribunals.\\r\\nTherefore, he wants to make the Government a party in order that they may be bound.\\r\\nBut, if they remain a party, it seems to me that there is a claim against them relating to property appertaining to the office of an hereditary officer, although no doubt it is quite true that the appellant does not desire to get any order against the Government as to the way in which the property should be dealt \\' with or anything of the sort, and he only wants a declaration as to his title which will bind Government.\" They held that the jurisdiction of the courts was oust ed.\\r\\nIt was next contended, on the strength of a decision of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council reported in Province of Bombay vs Horrnusji Manekji(2).\\r\\nthat the courts have jurisdiction to decide whether Government acted in excess of its powers and that that question must be decided first.\\r\\nIn my opinion, this decision does not apply here.\\r\\nTheir Lordships were dealing with a case falling under section 4 (b) of the Bombay Revenue Jurisdiction Act of 1876.\\r\\nThat provides that \". no Civil Court shall exercise jurisdiction as to. . (b) objections to the amount or incidence of any assess ment of land revenue authorised by the Provincial Govern ment.\\r\\n\" (1) (2) 74 I A. 103 417 As pointed out by Strangman K.C., on behalf of the plaintiff respondent, \"authorised\" must mean \"duly autho rised,\" and in that particular case the impugned assessment would not be duly authorised if the Government Resolution of 11 4 1990 purporting to treat the agreement relied on by the respondent as cancelled and authorising the levy of the full assessment was ultra vires under section 211 of the Land Revenue Code.\\r\\nThus, before the exclusion of the Civil Court \\'s jurisdiction under section 4 (b) could come into play, the Court had to determine the issue of ultra vires.\\r\\nConsequently, their Lordships held that that question was outside the scope of the bar.\\r\\nBut the position here is different.\\r\\nWe are concerned here with section 4 (a) and under that no question about an authorised act of Government arises.\\r\\nThe section is general and bars all \"claims against the Crown relating to lands. held as Saranjam.\\r\\n\" That is to say, even if the Government \\'s act in relation to such lands was ultra vires, a claim impugning the validity of such an act would fall within the scope of the exclusion in clause (a) provided it relates to such land.\\r\\nThere is a difference of opinion in the Bombay High Court as to whether section 4 is attracted if the only relief sought against Government is a declaration.\\r\\nOne set of decisions holds that that does not amount to a \"claim against Government.\\r\\n\" Dattatraya Vishwanath vs The Secretary of State for India(1) is typical of that view.\\r\\nOn the other hand, Daulatrao vs Government of bombay(2), a case relating to the Gajendragad estate, took the other view.\\r\\nIn my opin ion, the latter view is correct.\\r\\nIn my opinion, the decision of the High Court was right and I would dismiss the appeal with costs.\\r\\nPATANJALI SASTRI C.J.

Sinha (S.S. Prakasam, with him), for the appellant.\\r\\nR. Ganapathy Iyer, for the respondent.\\r\\nFebruary 14.\\r\\nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered by MUKHERJEA J.\\r\\nThis appeal has come up before us on special leave granted by this court on May 23, 1950, and it is directed against a judgment of a Division Bench of the Madras High Court dated April 10, 1950, by which the learned Judges found the appellant guilty of contempt of court and sentenced him to serve simple imprisonment for three months.\\r\\nThe appellant is the publisher and managing editor of a Telugu Weekly known as \"Praja Rajyam\" which is edited and published at Nellore in the State of Madras.\\r\\nIn the issue of the said paper dated 10th February, 1949, an article appeared under the caption \"Is the Sub Magistrate, Kovvur, corrupt?\" The purport of the article was that Surya Narayan Murthi, the stationary Sub Magistrate of Kovvur, was known to the people of the locality to be a bribe taker and to be in the habit of harassing litigants in various ways.\\r\\nHe was said to have a broker, through whom negotiations in connec tion with these corrupt practices were carried on.\\r\\nSeveral specific instances were cited of cases tried by that offi cer, where it was rumoured that he had either taken bribes or had put the parties to undue harassment, because they were obdurate enough to refuse the demands of his broker.\\r\\nThe article, which is a short one, concludes with the fol lowing paragraph: \"There are party factions in many villages in Kovvur Taluk.\\r\\nTaking advantage of those parties many wealthy persons make attempt to get the opposite party punished either by giving bribes or making recommendations.\\r\\nTo appoint Magistrates who run after parties for a Taluk like this. . is to betray the public.\\r\\nIt is tantamount to failure of justice.\\r\\nWill the Collector enquire into the matter and allay the public of their fears?\" 427 The attention of the State Government being drawn to this article, an application was filed by the AdvocateGener al of Madras before the High Court on November 14, 1949, under section 2 of the Contempt of Courts Act (Act XII of 1926) praying that suitable action might be taken against the appellant as well as three other persons, of whom two were respectively the editor and sub editor of the paper, while the third was the owner of the Press where the paper was printed.\\r\\nOn receiving notice, the appellant appeared before the High Court and filed an affidavit taking sole responsibility for the article objected to and asserting that the article was published because of his anxiety to uphold the highest traditions of the judiciary in the land and to create popular confidence in courts, the duty of which was to dispense justice without fear or favour and without any discrimination of caste, creed or community.\\r\\nIt was said that before the article was published, numerous complaints had reached him from various quarters imputing corruption and disreputable conduct to this Magistrate and the only desire of the appellant was to draw the attention of the higher authorities to the state of public opinion in the matter and to invite an enquiry into the truth or otherwise of the allegations which were not asserted as facts but were based only on hearsay.\\r\\nThe High Court after hearing the parties came to the conclusion that the publication in question did amount to contempt of court, as it was calculated to lower the pres tige and dignity of courts and bring into disrepute the administration of justice.\\r\\nAs the appellant was not prepared to substantiate the allegations which he made and which he admitted to be based on hearsay and did not think it proper even to express any regret for what he had done, the court sentenced him to simple imprisonment for three months.\\r\\nThe other three respondents, through their counsel, tendered unqualified apology to the court and the learned Judges considered that no further action against them was necessary.\\r\\n428 The propriety of the decision of the High Court so far as it relates to the appellant has been challenged before us in this appeal and Mr. Sinha, who appeared in support of the same, raised before us a two fold contention; his first and main contention is that as the contempt in this case was said to have been committed in respect of a court subordi nate to the High Court and the allegations made in the article in question constitute an offence under section 499 of the Indian Penal Code, the jurisdiction of the High Court to take cognizance of such a case is expressly barred under section 2 (3) of the Contempt of Courts Act.\\r\\nThe other contention advanced by the learned counsel relates to the merits of the case and it is urged that in publishing the article objected to, the appellant acted in perfect good faith, and as the article amounted to nothing else but a demand for enquiry into the conduct of a particular person who was believed to be guilty of corrupt practices in the discharge of his judicial duties, there was no contempt of court either intended or committed by the appellant.\\r\\nSo far as the first point is concerned, the determina tion of the question raised by the appellant would depend upon the proper interpretation to be put upon section 2(3) of the Contempt of Courts Act which runs as follows : \"No High Court shall take cognizance of a contempt alleged to have been committed in respect of a court subor dinate to it where such contempt is an offence punishable under the Indian Penal Code.\\r\\n\" According to Mr. Sinha, what the sub section means is that if the act by which a party is alleged to have commit ted contempt of a subordinate court constitutes offence of any description whatsoever punishable under the Indian Penal Code, the High Court is precluded from taking cognizance of it.\\r\\nIt is said that in the present case the allegations made in the article in question amount to an offence of defama tion as defined by section 499 of the Indian Penal Code and consequently the jurisdiction of the High Court is barred.\\r\\nReliance 429 is placed in support of this proposition upon the decision of the Nagpur High Court in Kisan Krishna Ji vs Nagpur Conference of Society of St. Vincent de Paul(1).\\r\\nThis con tention, though somewhat plausible at first sight, does not appear to us to be sound.\\r\\nIn our opinion, the sub section referred to above excludes the jurisdiction of High Court only.\\r\\nin cases where the acts alleged to constitute contempt of a subordinate court are punishable as contempt under specific provisions of the Indian Penal Code but not where these acts merely amount to offences of other description for which punishment has been provided for in the Indian Penal Code.\\r\\nThis would be clear from the language of the sub section which uses the words \"where such contempt is an offence\" and does not say \"where the act alleged to consti tute such contempt is an offence\".\\r\\nIt is argued that if such was the intention of the Legislature, it could have express ly said that the High Court \\'s jurisdiction will be ousted only when the contempt is punishable as such under the Indian Penal Code.\\r\\nIt seems to us that the reason for not using such language in the sub section may be that the expression \"contempt of court\" has not been used as descrip tion of any offence in the Indian Penal Code, though certain acts, which would be punishable as contempt of court in England, are made offences under it.\\r\\nIt may be pointed out in this connection that al though the powers of the High Courts in India established under the Letters Patent to exercise jurisdiction as Superi or Courts of Record in punishing contempt of their authority or processes have never been doubted, it was a controversial point prior to the passing of the Contempt of Courts Act, 1926, as to whether the High Court could, like the Court of King \\'s Bench in England, punish contempt of courts subordi nate to it in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction.\\r\\nThe doubt has been removed by Act XII of 1926 which expressly declares the right of the High Court to protect subordinate courts against contempt, but (1) (1943) A.I.R. 1943 Nag.\\r\\n430 subject to this restriction, that cases of contempt which have already been provided for in the Indian Penal Code should not be taken cognizance of by the High Court.\\r\\nThis seems to be the principle underlying section 2(3)of the Contempt of Courts Act.\\r\\nWhat these cases are need not be exhaustively determined for purposes of the present case, but some light is undoubtedly thrown upon this matter by the provision of section 480 of the Criminal Procedure Code, which empowers any civil, criminal or revenue court to punish summarily a person who is found guilty of committing any offence under sections 176, 178, 179, 180 or section 228 of the Indian Penal Code in the view or presence of the court.\\r\\nWe are not prepared to say, as has been said by the Patna High Court in Jnanendra prasad vs Gopal(1), that the only section of the Indian Penal Code which deals with contempt committed against a court of justice or judicial officer is section 228.\\r\\nOffences under sections 175, 178, 179 and 180 may also, as section 480 of the Criminal Proce dure Code shows, amount to contempt of court if the \"public servant\" referred to in these sections happens to be a judicial officer in a particular case.\\r\\nIt is well known that the aim of the contempt proceeding is \"to deter men from offering any indignities to a court of justice\" and an essential feature of the proceeding is the exercise of a summary power by the court itself in regard to the delin quent.\\r\\nIn the cases mentioned in section 480 of the Indian Penal Code, the court has been expressly given summary powers to punish a person who is guilty of offending its dignity in the manner indicated in the section.\\r\\nThe court is competent also under section 482 of the Criminal Proce dure Code to forward any case of this description to a Magistrate having jurisdiction to try it, if it considers that the offender deserves a higher punishment than what can be inflicted under section 480.\\r\\nAgain, the court is enti tled under section 484 to discharge the offender on his submitting an apology, although it has already adjudged him to punishment under section Pat.\\r\\n172. 431 or forwarded his case for trial under section 482.\\r\\nThe mode of purging contempt by tendering apology is a further char acteristic of a contempt proceeding.\\r\\nIt seems, therefore, that there are offences which are punishable as contempt under the Indian Penal Code and as subordinate courts can sufficiently vindicate their dignity under the provisions of criminal law in such cases the legislature deemed it proper to exclude them from the jurisdiction of the High Court under section 2(3) of the Contempt of Courts Act;but it would not be correct to \\' say that the High Court \\'s juris diction is excluded even in cases where the act complained of, which is alleged to constitute contempt, is otherwise an offence under the Indian Penal Code.\\r\\nThis view has been taken and, in our opinion quite rightly, in a number of decisions by the Calcutta,(1) Patna,(2) Allahabad(3) and Lahore(4) High Courts.\\r\\nThe only authority which Mr. Sinha could cite in support of his contention is the decision of the Nagpur High Court in Kisan Krishna Ji vs Nagpur Conference of Society of St. Vincent de Paul(\").\\r\\nThe authority is undoubtedly in his favour as it proceeds upon the assumption that the idea underlying the provision of section 2(3) of the Contempt of Courts Act is that if a person can be punished by some other tribunal, then the High Court should not entertain any proceeding for contempt.\\r\\nIt is to be noticed that the learned Judge, who decided this case, himself took the opposite view in the case of Subordinate Judge, First Class, Hoshangabad vs Jawaharlal(6) and definitely held that the prohibition contained in section 2(3) of the Contempt of Courts Act refers to offences punishable as contempt of court by the Indian Penal Code and not to offences punishable otherwise than as contempt.\\r\\nThis decision was neither noticed nor dissented from in the subsequent case, and it is quite possible that (1) Narayan Chandra vs Panehu Pramanik (A.I.R. ; Naresh Kumar.v.\\r\\nUmaromar (A.I.R. 1951 Cal.\\r\\n(2)Kaulashia vs Emperor (12 Pat. 1).\\r\\n(3) State vs Brahma Prakash (A.I.R. 1950 All. 556); Emperor vs Jagannath (A.I.R. 1938 All. 358).\\r\\n(4) Bennett Coleman vs G. section Monga (I.L.R. (5) A.I.R. 1943 Nag.\\r\\n(6) A.I.R. 1940 Nag.\\r\\n56 432 the attention of the learned judge was not drawn to this earlier pronouncement of his, in which case the matter would certainly have been more fully discussed.\\r\\nWe think further that the decision of the Calcutta High Court in V.M. Bason vs A. H. Skone(1) which was the basis of the decision of the learned Judge in the subsequent case does not really support the view taken in it.\\r\\nIn the Calcutta case what happened was, that a clerk of the Attorney, who appeared for the respondent decreeholder, went to serve a notice under Order 21, Rule 37(1), of the Civil Procedure Code upon the appellant judgment debtor.\\r\\nThe judgmentdebtor refused to take the notice and abused and assaulted the Attorney \\'s clerk.\\r\\nUpon that, contempt proceedings were started against him and Mr. Justice C.C. Ghosh, sitting on the Original Side of the High Court of Calcutta, held the appellant guilty of contempt and fined him Rs. 200.\\r\\nOn appeal, this judgment was affirmed by the appellate Bench and there was a general observation made by Chief Justice Sanderson at the close of his judgment that it is not desirable to invoke the special inherent jurisdiction of the High Court by way of proceeding for contempt if ordinary proceedings in a Magistrate \\'s court are sufficient to meet the requirements of a case.\\r\\nThis was not a case under section 2(3) of the Contempt of Courts Act at all and no question either arose or was decided as to whether if an act is otherwise punishable as an offence under the Indian Penal Code the jurisdiction of the High Court under that section would be ousted.\\r\\nUndoubtedly the High Court had jurisdiction in that case and whether such jurisdiction, which is certainly of a special character and is exercised summarily, should be called in to aid in the circumstances of a particular case would depend upon the discretion of the court.\\r\\nThis has, however, no bearing on the point that has arisen for consideration before us.\\r\\nWe would hold, therefore, that the right view was taken by the learned Judge of the Nagpur High Court in the earlier case and not in the later one, (1) I.L R. 433 It is next urged by Mr. Sinha that even assuming that this view is correct, the language of section 499 of the Indian Penal Code is wide enough to cover a case of contempt of court.\\r\\nWhat is said is, that if a libel is published against a judge in respect of his judicial functions, that also is defamation within the meaning of section 499 of the Indian Penal Code and as such libel constitutes a contempt of court, it may be said with perfect propriety that libel on a judge is punishable as contempt under the Indian Penal Code.\\r\\nWe do not think that this contention can be accepted as sound.\\r\\nA libellous reflection upon the conduct of a judge in respect of his judicial duties may certainly come under section 499 of the Indian Penal Code and it may be open to the judge to take steps against the libeller in the ordinary way for vindication of his character and personal dignity as a judge; but such libel may or may not amount to contempt of court.\\r\\nAs the Privy Council observed in Surendra Nath Banerjee vs The Chief Justice and Judges of the High Court,(1) \"although contempt may include defamation, yet an offence of contempt is something more than mere defamation and is of a different character.\\r\\n\" When the act of defaming a judge is calculated to obstruct or interfere with the due course of justice or proper administration of law, it would certainly amount to contempt.\\r\\nTIle offence of con tempt is really a wrong done to the public by weakening the authority and influence of courts of law which exist for their good.\\r\\nAs was said by Willmot, C.J.(2) \"attacks upon the judges excite in the minds of the people a general dissatisfaction with all judicial determi nations. and whenever man \\'s allegiance to the laws is so fundamentally shaken it is the most fatal and dangerous obstruction of justice and in my opinion calls out for a more rapid and immediate redress than any other obstruction whatsoever; not for the sake of the judges as private indi viduals but because they are the channels by which the King \\'s justice is conveyed to the people\".\\r\\n(1) I.L.R. at 131.\\r\\n(2) Willmot \\'s Opinions page 256; Rex vs Davies 30 at p. 40 41. 434 What is made punishable in the Indian Penal Code is the offence of defamation as defamation and not as.\\r\\ncontempt of court.\\r\\nIf the defamation of a subordinate court amounts to contempt of court, proceedings can certainly be taken under section 2 of the Contempt of Courts Act, quite apart from the fact that other remedy may be open to the aggrieved officer under section 499 of the Indian Penal Code.\\r\\nBut a libel attacking the integrity of a judge may not in the circumstances of a particular case amount to a contempt at all, although it may be the subject matter of a libel pro ceeding.\\r\\nThis is clear from the observation of the Judicial Committee in the case of The Matter of a Special Reference from the Bahama Islands(1).\\r\\nThe first contention of Mr. Sinha, therefore, fails.\\r\\nThe second point raised by the learned counsel does not appear to us to have any real substance.\\r\\nThe article in question is a scurrilous attack on the integrity and honesty of a judicial officer.\\r\\nSpecific instances have been given where the officer is alleged to have taken bribes or behaved with impropriety to the litigants who did not satisfy his dishonest demands.\\r\\nIf the allegations were true, obviously it would be to the benefit of the public to bring these matters into light.\\r\\nBut if they were false, they cannot but undermine the confidence of the public in the administration of justice and bring judiciary into disrepute.\\r\\nThe appel lant, though he took sole responsibility regarding the publication of the article, was not in a position to sub stantiate by evidence any of the allegations made therein.\\r\\nHe admitted that the statement was based on hearsay.\\r\\nRu mours may have reached him from various sources, but before he published the article it was incumbent upon him as a reasonable man to attempt to verify the informations he received and ascertain, as far as he could.\\r\\nwhether the facts were true or mere concocted lies.\\r\\nHe does not appear to have made any endeavour in this direction.\\r\\nAs the appel lant did not act with reasonable care and caution, he cannot be said to have acted (1) 435 bona fide, even if good faith can be held to be a defence at all in a proceeding for contempt.\\r\\nWhat is more, he did not express any regret for what he had done either in the High Court or before us and his behaviour does not show the least trace of contrition.\\r\\nIn these circumstances, we think that the appeal cannot succeed and must be dismissed.\\r\\nAppeal dismissed.\\r\\n', {'entities': [[3, 34, 'CASE_NUMBER'], [95, 115,

Jurisdiction and powers of all courts except the Federal Court, with respect to any of the matters in this List . \" Entry 15, List III : \"Jurisdiction and powers of all courts except the Feder al Court, with respect to any of the matters in this List.\\r\\n\" The respondents \\' contention may appear at the first sight to be a plausible one, but, in my opinion, it is not well founded in law.\\r\\nFor the purpose of correctly deciding the question raised, we must first try to understand the meaning of the following items in entry 1 of List II, \"administration of justice, constitution and organization of all courts except the Federal Court.\\r\\n\" A reference to the three Legislative Lists shows that \"administration of jus tice\" is entirely a provincial subject on which only the Provincial Legislature can legislate.\\r\\nThe same remark ap plies to \"constitution and organization of all courts except the Federal Court.\\r\\n\" The expression \"administration of jus tice\" has a wide meaning, and includes administration of civil as well as criminal justice, and in my opinion entry 1 in List II, which I have quoted, is a complete and self contained entry.\\r\\nIn this entry, no reference is made to the jurisdiction and powers of courts, because the expressions \"administration of justice\" and \"constitution and organi zation of courts\", which have been used therein without any qualification or limitation, are wide enough to include the \\'power and jurisdiction of courts, for how can justice be administered if courts have no power and jurisdiction to administer it, and how can courts function without any power or jurisdiction.\\r\\nOnce this fact is clearly 56 grasped, it follows that, by virtue of the words used in entry 1 of List II, the Provincial Legislature can invest the courts constituted by it with power and jurisdiction to try every cause or matter that can be dealt with by a court of civil or criminal jurisdiction,and that the expression \"administration of justice\" must necessarily include the power to try suits and proceedings of a civil as well as criminal nature, irrespective of who the parties to the suit or proceeding or what its subject matter may be.\\r\\nThis power must necessarily include the power of defining, enlarging, altering, amending and diminishing the jurisdiction of the courts and defining their jurisdiction territorially and pecuniarily.\\r\\nThe question then arises as to the exact meaning of entry 2 of List II and entry 53 of List I, which are said to militate against the above construction.\\r\\nThese entries, in my opinion, confer special powers on Provincial and Central Legislatures, as opposed to the general power conferred on the Provincial Legislature by entry 1 of List II, the spe cial powers being the logical consequence or concomitant of the power of the two Legislatures to legislate with regard to the matters included in their respective Legislative Lists.\\r\\nThe effect of these entries is that while legislating with regard to the matters in their respective Legislative Lists, the two Legislatures are competent also to make provisions in the several Acts enacted by them, concerning the jurisdiction and powers of courts in regard to the subject matter of the Acts, because otherwise the legisla tion may not be quite complete or effective.\\r\\nThe words used in entry 2 of List II and entry 53 of List I are wide enough to empower the two Legislatures to legislate negatively as well as affirmatively with regard to the jurisdiction of the courts in respect of the matters within their respective legislative ambits.\\r\\nIn other words, they can exclude or bar the jurisdiction of the courts in regard to those matters, and they can also confer special jurisdiction on certain courts.\\r\\nThey can also, apart from the general power which the courts usually exercise, confer power on the courts to 57 pass certain special orders, instances of which I shall give later.\\r\\nIn this connection, reference may be made to section 9 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which provides that \"the Courts shall have jurisdiction to try all suits of a civil nature \\' excepting suits of which their cognizance is either expressly or impliedly barred.\\r\\n\" This section obviously postulates among other things the barring of the jurisdiction of the civil courts by Legislatures with respect to particular classes of suits of a civil nature, and the statute book abounds in instances in which the jurisdiction of the civil courts is barred under Acts passed by the Central and Provincial Legislatures.\\r\\nThere are also many Acts providing that any suit or proceed ing concerning the subjects matters of those Acts shall be triable by the court or courts specified therein.\\r\\nSuch provisions are to be found in a number of Acts enacted both prior to and after the enactment of the Government of India Act, 1935, and there can be no doubt that the British Par liament while enacting that Act was fully aware of the existing legislative practice obtaining in this country as well as of the fact that the provisions in question were sometimes necessary and therefore it empowered the Central and Provincial Legislatures to make them under entry 53 of List I and entry 2 of List II, respectively.\\r\\nThis, in my opinion, is the true meaning of these entries, and it also explains why a separate entry was necessary enabling the two Legislatures to legislate with regard to the power and jurisdiction of the courts in respect of the subject matters mentioned in the three Legislative Lists.\\r\\nBut for an express provision like that made in the entries referred to above, the two Legislatures might not have been able to confer special jurisdiction on the courts in regard to the matters set out in the Legislative Lists, nor could they have been able to bar the jurisdiction of the ordinary courts in regard to them, however necessary or desirable such a course might have appeared to them.\\r\\n8 58 It should be noted that the words used in these entries are: \"jurisdiction and power\".\\r\\n\"Power\" is a comprehensive word, which includes all the procedural and substantive powers which may be exercised by a court, but the full significance of the use of the word in the context can be grasped only by reading a large number of local and special Acts in which power has been given to Courts to pass certain special and unusual orders.\\r\\nFor example, section 13 of the Indian , provides that \" where any person is convicted of an offence punishable under any rule made under clauses . the Court by which he is convicted may direct that the aircraft or arti cle or substance, as the case may be, in respect of which the offence has been committed, shall be forfeited to His Majesty.\\r\\n\" Reference may also be made to section 24 of the Indian Arms Act, 1878, which provides that \"when any person is convicted of an offence punishable under this Act, committed by him in respect of any arms, ammunition or military stores, it shall be in the discretion of the convicting Court or Magistrate further to direct that the whole or any portion of such arms, ammunition or mili tary stores, and any vessel . . . shall be confiscated.\" (See also section 10 of the [Act I of 1944], and section 13 of the Food Adul teration Act, 1919 [Bengal Act VI of 1919], which are in similar terms, and the various Acts relating to money lend ers and money lending which confer special power on the courts of reopening several kinds of transactions for the relief of debtors.) It seems to me that the word \"power\" was added to the word \"jurisdiction\", in entry 53 of List I, entry 2 of List II, and entry 15 of List III, in order to enable the two Legislatures to grant special powers like those I have mentioned to the courts which are to deal with the subject matter of any special legislation.\\r\\nA reference to the Acts passed after the enactment of the Government of India Act, 1935, will show that 59 special provisions with regard to the jurisdiction of courts have been made even after the passing of that Act, in a large number of Central and local Acts.\\r\\nConfining ourselves to the Acts passed by the Bombay Legislature, since we are concerned here with one of such Acts, we find that in The Bombay Probation of Offenders Act, 1938 (Bombay Act No. XIX of 1938), section a empowers the following courts \"to exer cise powers under the Act, (a) the High Court, (b) a Court of Session, (c) a District Magistrate, (d) a Sub Divisional Magistrate, (e) a salaried Magistrate . \" Similarly, in the Bombay Agricultural Produce Markets Act, 1939, sec tion 23 provides that \"no offence under this Act . shall be tried by a Court other than that of a Presidency Magistrate, or a Magistrate of the First Class or a Magis trate of the Second Class specially empowered in this be half.\\r\\n\" Section 11 of the Bombay Cotton Control Act, 1942, provides that \"no criminal court inferior to that of a Presidency Magistrate or a Magistrate of the Second Class shall try any offence under this Act\".\\r\\nSection 19 of the Bombay Sales of Motor Spirit Taxation Act, 1946, and section 5 of the Bombay Harijan Temple Entry Act, 1947, are provi sions which exclude the jurisdiction of courts under certain circumstances.\\r\\nSimilar instances may be multiplied from the Acts of the Central Legislature and other Provincial Legis latures, but, in my opinion, the instances I have quoted are sufficient to show (1) that the practice which prevailed before the Government of India Act has continued even after its enactment, and (2) that the words \"jurisdiction and powers\" have been consistently construed to bear the meaning which I have attributed to them.\\r\\nThe interpretation which is sought to be put on the entries by the respondent is in my opinion open to the following objections : (1).It involves the curtailment of the meaning of the expression \"administration of justice\" in such a way as to rob it of its primary content the jurisdiction and powers of the court, without which justice cannot be administered.\\r\\n60 (2) It makes it necessary to read entry 2 of List II as part of entry 1 of the same List, though it has been sepa rately numbered as an independent entry.\\r\\nThis is opposed to the scheme followed in the three Legislative Lists, which seems to be that each particular entry should relate to a separate subject or group of cognate subjects, each subject or group of subjects being independent of the others (subject only to incidental overlapping).\\r\\nThe construction suggested by the respondents makes it necessary to assume that though according to their line of reasoning the words \"jurisdiction and powers of courts, etc.\\r\\n\" occurring in entry 2 of List II should have been put in entry 1 of the same List, being intimately connected with the subject of \"admin istration of justice and the constitution and organization of courts\", it was without any apparent reason numbered separately and made an independent entry.\\r\\n(3) The suggested construction would exclude from the jurisdiction of the Provincial Courts a large number of matters which normally come before courts exercising civil or criminal jurisdiction and, if it is accepted, the courts will not be able to function in the fullest sense unless both the Provincial and Central Legislatures have by piece meal legislation or otherwise exhausted their power of legislating on all the subjects comprised in Lists II and I respectively.\\r\\nEven after they have exhausted such power, the courts will not be able to deal with important matters, such as contracts, transfer of property, arbitration, wills and succession, criminal law, etc., which are subjects mentioned in List III, until one of the two Legislatures has legislated in regard to those subjects, which raises two important questions: (1) Which of the two Legislatures has to do it first; and (2) How is the conflict to be avoided ? That the construction put by the respondents will lead to anomalous results which could not have been within the contemplation of the British Parliament while enacting the Government of India Act, 1935, may be illustrated by one or two examples.\\r\\nReference 61 might here be made to entry 26 of List I, which deals with \"carriage of passengers and goods by sea or by b air.\\r\\n\" It should be supposed that if any of the goods carried by air are lost and a suit is instituted in regard to them, the suit will be triable by the court having jurisdiction over the matter under the Civil Procedure Code, subject to any special legislation on the subject by the Central Legisla ture, in spite of the fact that the carriage of goods and passengers by sea or by air is a subject mentioned in List I.\\r\\nBut, on the view propounded before us by the respondent, the Provincial civil courts will not be competent to try such a suit, unless they are empowered to do so by the Central Legislature.\\r\\nIn order to show to what absurd result this doctrine may be pushed, and in order to avoid the criticism of taking for granted what is in controversy, we may take a very extreme example, because the soundness of the respondents \\' contention can be tested only by trying to find out what would happen if we were to stretch it to the utmost limit to which it can be stretched.\\r\\nEntry 13 in List I is: \"the Banaras Hindu University and the Aligarh Muslim University.\" Under entry 53 of List I, the Central Legisla ture has power to legislate in regard to the jurisdiction and powers of courts in respect of the subject matter of entry 13.\\r\\nIt may therefore be supposed, having regard to the wide language used in entry 13, that it is open to the Central Legislature to enact that suits in which these Universities are concerned as plaintiff or as defendant, will be triable only by the particular court mentioned in the enactment concerned and that no other court shall have jurisdiction in regard to such suits, It is difficult to think that until such a legislation is made, a court which would otherwise be the proper court, has no jurisdiction to try any suit in which one of these Universities is a party, no matter what the subject matter of the suit may be.\\r\\nI am certain that the framers of the Government of India Act did not contemplate such a result.\\r\\nWe all know that at the date when the Government of India Act, 1935, was passed, there were in existence 62 in the different Provinces a large number of courts of law and the administration of justice throughout the Provinces was in the hands of these provincial courts.\\r\\nThe civil courts in the Province used to try all suits and proceedings of a civil nature which are triable under section 9 of the Civil Procedure Code, and the criminal courts used to try all criminal cases which are triable under the Code of Criminal Procedure.\\r\\nThe jurisdiction and power of the courts were not confined to cases in regard to the subjects stated in List II, nor were they debarred from dealing with cases relating to matters which have been assigned to List I.\\r\\nThe jurisdiction of the courts depended in civil cases on a \"cause of action\" giving rise to a civil liability, and in criminal cases on the commission of an offence, and on the provisions made in the two Codes of Procedure as to the venue of the trial and other relevant matters.\\r\\nIt seems to me that the Government of India Act, 1935, did not contem plate any drastic change in the existing system of adminis tration of justice, but what it contemplated was that that system should continue subject to future legislation by the proper Legislature; Central or Provincial, barring the jurisdiction of courts or conferring jurisdiction or power on special courts with regard to the matters included in the appropriate Legislative Lists, should there be any occasion for such special legislation.\\r\\nUnder the Govern ment of India Act, 1935, every Province became more or less an autonomous unit with a complete machinery for administer ing justice to the fullest extent.\\r\\nIn my opinion, there is nothing in the Act of 1935 to show that there was any inten tion on the part of its framers to affect the machinery so drastically as to confine it to the administration of a mere partial or truncated kind of justice relating only to mat ters specified in List II.\\r\\nMr. Setalvad, the ]earned Attorney Genera], who ap peared on behalf of the appellant, in supporting the im pugned Act, argued before us that for the purpose of decid ing this appeal, we might also refer to entry 4 List III.\\r\\nHis contention was that the impugned 63 Act having had the assent of the Governor General, it would be permissible to see what powers the Provincial Legislature could exercise under Lists II and III taken together.\\r\\nIf the course which he suggests is adopted, then the subjects on which the Provincial Legislature can legislate would be: (1) administration of justice; (2)constitution and organiza tion of courts; and (3) civil procedure, including all matters included in the Code of Civil Procedure at the date of the passing of the Government of India Act, 1935.\\r\\nOne of the matters included in the Civil Procedure Code is the jurisdiction of courts, Section 9 of the Code provides, as I have already stated, that the courts shall have jurisdic tion to try all suits of a civil nature excepting suits of which their cognizance is either expressly or impliedly barred.\\r\\nThere are are also provisions in the Code dealing with the territorial and pecuniary jurisdiction of the courts.\\r\\nThe three entries will thus cover exactly the field which is covered by item 14 of section 92 of the Canadian Constitution which comprises the following matters: \"administration of justice in the Provinces, including constitution, maintenance and organization of provincial courts both of civil and criminal jurisdiction including procedure in civil matters in those courts.\\r\\n\" It has been held in Canada that the words referred to above include the power and jurisdiction of courts, and, under that item, the provincial Legislature can confer the widest power on the courts.\\r\\nIt seems to me that the approach suggested by the learned Attorney General is useful for testing whether entry 2 of List II was intended to be treated as the sole and only basis of the power of the Provincial Legislature to confer jurisdiction on the provincial courts and whether it was really the intention of the British Parliament to empower the Provincial Legislature to confer jurisdiction of only such a limited character as can be conferred on the provin cial courts under entry 2 of List II, if that entry is treated as a self sufficient entry.\\r\\nIn my opinion, the correct view is to hold that it is not necessary to call into aid either entry 4 of List III or any of the 64 provisions of the Canadian Constitution in this case, and that the words \"administration of justice; constitution and organization of courts\" are by themselves sufficient to empower the Provincial Legislature to invest a new court with all the power which has been conferred upon it by the impugned Act.\\r\\nIt is of course open to the Central Legisla ture to bar the jurisdiction of the new court by a special enactment with regard to any of the matters in List I, but so long as such jurisdiction is not barred, the court will have jurisdiction try all suits and proceedings of a civil nature as enacted in the Act in question.\\r\\nI think that if the Provincial Legislature had merely enhanced the pecuniary jurisdiction of any of the existing civil courts there could have been no objection to that course.\\r\\nWhy then should there, be any objection when, instead of investing one of the existing courts with power to try suits and proceedings of a civil nature not exceeding a certain amount, the Legis lature has created a new court and invested it with the same power.\\r\\nPerhaps, it will be simpler to deal at this stage with the third question, namely, whether the Bombay City Civil Court has jurisdiction to try a suit based on a promissory note.\\r\\nSo far as this point is concerned, the respondent bases his contention on entries 28 and 33 of List I. Entry 28 relates to \"cheques, bills of exchange, promissory notes and other like instruments\".\\r\\nEntry 53, as already stated, relates to \"jurisdiction and powers of courts with respect to any of the matters in List I.\" It is contended on behalf of the respondent that the effect of these two entries, when they are read together, is that no court can try a suit relating to a promissory note, unless it is invested with the jurisdiction to try such a suit by the Central Legisla ture by virtue of the power given by entry 53 of List I. The question so raised is covered by the answer to the first question, and I shall only add that the answer already given to that question finds some support in the case of Prafulla Kumar Mukherjee and Others vs Bank of Commerce Limited Khulnal (1), in which the arguments of the (1) [1947] F.C.R.28.\\r\\n65 respondents before the Privy Council proceeded on the same lines as the arguments of the respondents before us.\\r\\nThe question raised in that case was as to the validity of the Bengal Money lenders \\' Act, 1940, which limited the amount recoverable by a money lender on his loans and interests on them, and prohibited the payments of sums larger than those permitted by the Act.\\r\\nThe validity of the Act was questioned by the respondent Bank in certain suits brought by them to recover loans and interests alleged to be due on promisso ry notes executed by the appellants borrowers as well as in suits brought by the debtors claiming relief under the Act.\\r\\nThe argument put forward on behalf of the Bank was that the Bengal Legislature by the impugned Act had attempted to legislate on subjects expressly forbidden to it and expressly and exclusively reserved for the Federal Legislature, that is to say, in relation to promissory notes and banking, which are reserved for the Federal Legislature exclusively, under entries 28 and 38 respectively of List I.\\r\\nOn the other hand, the arguments put forward on behalf of the appellants was that the impugned Act was in pith and substance legislation dealing with money lending and that in so far as it dealt with promissory notes or banking that was only incidental or ancillary to the effective use of the admitted legislative powers of the Provincial Legislature to deal with money lending. \\'This argument of the appellants was substantially accepted by the Privy Council.\\r\\nThe second point raised on behalf of the respondent relates to the validity of section 4 of the Act, which runs as follows : \"Subject to the exceptions specified in section 3, the Provincial Government, may by notification in the Official Gazette, invest the City Civil Court with jurisdiction to receive, try and dispose of all suits and other proceedings of a civil nature, arising within the Greater Bombay and of such value not exceeding Rs. 25,000 as may be specified in the notification.\\r\\n\" 9 66 It is contended that this section is invalid, because the Provincial Legislature has thereby delegated its legis lative powers to the Provincial Government which it cannot do.\\r\\nThis contention does not appear to me to be sound.\\r\\nThe section itself shows that the provincial Legislature having exercised its judgment and determined that the new Court should be invested with jurisdiction to try suits and pro ceedings of a civil nature of a value not exceeding Rs. 25,000, left it to the Provincial Government to determine when the Court should be invested with this larger jurisdic tion, for which the limit had been fixed.\\r\\nIt is clear that if and when the new court has to be invested with the larger jurisdiction, that jurisdiction would be due to no other authority than the Provincial Legislature itself and the court would exercise that jurisdiction by virtue of the Act itself.\\r\\nAs several of my learned colleagues have pointed out, the case of Queen vs Burah (1), the authority of which was not questioned before us, fully covers the contention raised, and the impugned provision is an instance of what the Privy Council has designated as conditional legislation, and does not really delegate any legislative power but merely prescribes as to how effect is to be given to what the Legislature has already decided.\\r\\nAs the Privy Council has pointed out, legislation conditional on the use of particular powers or on the exercise of a limited discretion entrusted by the Legislature to persons in whom it places confidence, is no uncommon thing, and in many instances it may be highly convenient and desirable.\\r\\nExamples of such legislation abound in England, America and other countries.\\r\\nAs some of the American Judges have remarked, \"there are many things upon which wise and useful legislation must depend which cannot be known to the law making power and must therefore be the subject of enquiry and determination outside the halls of legislation (Field vs Clark (2).\\r\\nMr. Setalvad, the learned Attorney General who appeared on behalf of the appellant, contended that in this country even delegated legislation is (1) 3 A.C. 889.\\r\\n(2) ; , 67 permissible, but I do not consider it necessary to go into that question, because the principle enunciated in Queen vs BUrah(1) is sufficient to dispose of the contention raised here.\\r\\nI think that the present case stands well outside what was laid down by the Federal Court in Jitendranath Gupta vs The Province of Bihar,(2) as two of my colleagues who were parties to the majority decision in that case have pointed out.\\r\\nIn the result, this appeal is allowed.\\r\\nPATANJALI SASTRI J.\\r\\nThis appeal raises the important ques tion of the constitutional validity of the Bombay City Civil Court Act, 1948 (hereinafter referred to as the Act) and though I concur in the conclusion reached by the majority of my learned brothers I wish to state precisely the reasons which lead me to that conclusion.\\r\\nThe first respondent brought the suit in the High Court at Bombay on its orginal side for recovery of Rs. 11,704 from the second respondent on promissory notes.\\r\\nNotwithstanding that the jurisdiction of the High Court to try suits cog nisable by the City Civil Court was barred under section 12 of the Act and the pecuniary limit of the jurisdiction of the latter court had been enhanced from Rs. 10,000 to Rs. 25,000 by a notification issued by the Provincial Government under section 4 of the Act, it was stated in the plaint that the High Court had jurisdiction to try the suit because the Act as well as the said notification was ultra vires and void.\\r\\nIn view of the constitutional issues thus raised, the State of Bombay, the appellant herein was on its own motion, made a party defendant.\\r\\nThe High Court (Chagla C.J. and Tendolkar J.) held (1) the Act was intra vires, but (2) that section 4 which autho rised the Provincial Government to enhance the jurisdiction of the City Court up to the limit of Rs. 25,000 amounted to a delegation of legislative power, and as such, was void and inoperative, with the result that the suit, which ex ceeded Rs. 10,000 in (1)5 I.A. 178.\\r\\n(2) 68 value and was not cognisable by the City Court apart from the impeached notification, was held to have been property laid in the High Court.\\r\\nBoth these findings have been challenged before us as erroneous, the first by the first respondent and the second by the appellant.\\r\\nOn the first point, learned counsel for the first re spondent urged that section 100 of the Government of india Act, 1935, read with entries 53 of List I, 2 of List II and 15 of List III, the relevant parts of which are in identical terms, namely, \"jurisdiction and powers of all courts except the Federal Court with respect to any of the matters in this List\", conferred power on Legislatures in British India to make laws with respect to jurisdiction of courts only in relation to matters falling within their respec tive legislative fields, and that, therefore, the expres sions \"administration of justice\" and \"constitution and organisation of courts\" in entry 1 of List II, although they might be wide enough, if that entry stood alone, to include the topic of \"jurisdiction and powers of courts\", should not be construed in that comprehensive sense as such construc tion would give no effect to the limiting words in entry 2 which would then become meaningless indeed if those expres sions in entry 1 included the power to legislate with re spect to jurisdiction also, there would be no need for entry 2, while, on the other hand, without including such power, they would still have ample content, as various other mat ters relating to administration of justice and constitu tion of courts would have to be provided for, The scheme disclosed by the three separate entries in identical terms in the three lists was said to be this: The, Provincial Legislatures were to have the power of constituting courts and providing for administration of justice, but the power to invest the courts with jurisdiction was to rest with the Federal Legislature in respect of the matters mentioned in List I and with the Provincial Legislature in respect of the matters mentioned in List Ii, while both the Federal and the Provincial Legislatures were to have such power with respect to 69 the matters mentioned in List III subject to the provisions of section 107.\\r\\nIt was, therefore, submitted that the Act, in so far as it purported to provide by section 3 that the City Civil Court established thereunder \"shall have juris diction to receive, try and dispose of all suits and other proceedings of a civil nature not exceeding Rs. 10,000 in value and arising within Greater Bombay\" (with certain exceptions not material here) was ultra vires the Provincial Legislature, constituting as it did a direct invasion of the Federal field marked out by entry 53 of List I.\\r\\nAs all the three entries dealt with the same topic of jurisdiction and powers of courts, there was no room, it was said, for the application of the doctrine of incidental enroachment.\\r\\nThe argument is not without force.\\r\\nThe Bombay High Court in Mulchand vs Raman (1), which was followed by the learned Judges in the present case, and the Attorney General who adopted the same line before us, invoked the doctrine of pith and substance in answer to the argument on behalf of the respondent.\\r\\nBut that doctrine, while it often furnishes the key to the solution of problems arising out of the distribution of overlapping legislative powers in a Federal system, is not of much assistance in meeting the difficulty in finding any usefulness in entry 2 if under entry 1 the Provincial Legislature were intended to have the power to legislate generally with respect to the jurisdiction and powers of courts.\\r\\nThe greater power must include the less.\\r\\nA similar difficulty in construing entry 4 of List III and entry 2 of List II arose in Stewart vs Brojendra Kishore (2) and led a Division Bench of the Calcutta High Court to construe the expression \"civil procedure\" occurring in the former entry in a \"limited sense\" as excluding jurisdiction and powers of courts.\\r\\nAfter referring to the decision of the Judicial Committee in In re Marriage Reference(3) where \"marriage ,and divorce\" in the Dominion List was construed as excluding matters relating to the \"solemnisation of marriage (1) 51 B.L.R. 86.\\r\\n(3) 628 (2) A.I.R. 1939 Cal.\\r\\n628 70 in the province\" because the latter topic was specifically included in the Provincial List, the learned Judges ob served: \"The position is similar here. \\'Civil procedure \\' in the Concurrent Legislative List must be held to exclude matters relating to jurisdiction and powers of courts since special provision is made for those matters elsewhere in the lists.\" \"To hold otherwise\", they pointed out, \"would be completely to wipe out the second entry in the Provincial Legislative List.\" Learned counsel for the first respondent strongly relied on that decision and suggested that, if it had been brought to the notice of the learned Judges in Mulchand vs Raman (1), their decision might well have been the other way.\\r\\nOn the other hand, the Attorney General submitted that there could be no question of conflict between two entries in the same list and that the natural meaning of one should not be restricted simply because of the presence of the other.\\r\\nHe placed reliance on the following observations of Gwyer C.J. in Aliqa Begum \\'s case (4) \"It would be practi cally impossible for example to define each item in the Provincial List in such a way as to make it exclusive of every item in that list and Parliament seems to have been content to take a number of comprehensive categories and to describe each of them by words of broad and general import.\\r\\nI think, however, that none of the items in the lists is to be read in a narrow or restricted sense and that each general word should be held to extend to all ancillary or subsidiary matters which can fairly and reasonably be said to be comprehended in it.\\r\\n\" These observations were, however, made to support the conclusion that the power to legislate with respect to\" collection of rents\" under entry 21 of List II includes the power to legislate with respect to any limitation on the power of a landlord to collect rents, that is to say, with respect to the remission of rents as well, and that, therefore, the United Provinces Regularisation of Remissions Act, 1933, was intra vires.\\r\\nGeneral observations made in such context (4) ,134 71 do not answer the objection that the wider construction of entry 1 would deprive entry 2 of all its content and reduce it to useless lumber.\\r\\nI am therefore, of opinion that the words\" \\' administration of justice\" and \"constitution and organisation of courts\" occurring in entry 1 must be under stood in a restricted sense excluding from their scope \"jurisdiction and powers of courts\" dealt with specifically in entry 2.\\r\\nThis does not, however, compel the conclusion that it is beyond the competence of the Provincial Legislature to confer general jurisdiction on courts constituted by it, for, if entry 1 does not by itself enable the legislature to do so, entry 2 certainly does when read with entry 1.\\r\\nIt should be remembered and this is what the argument for restricting the legislative power of provinces in regard to jurisdiction overlooks that \"administration of justice\" is one of the matters mentioned in List II itself.\\r\\nThe Provin cial Legislature, therefore, is competent under entry 2 to legislate conferring jurisdiction on courts with respect to administration of justice, that is to say, general juris diction to administer justice by adjudicating on all matters brought before them, except, of course, matters excluded expressly or by implication either by an existing law con tinued in force or by a statute passed by the appropriate legislature under the entries in the three Lists relating to jurisdiction and powers of courts.\\r\\nIn other words, though \"administration of justice\" in entry 1 does not authorise legislation with respect to jurisdiction and powers of courts, the legislative power under entry 2 in regard to the tatter topic, which can be legitimately exercised\" with respect to any of the matters in this List,\" can be exer cised with respect to administration of justice, one of the matters comprised in that List, with the result that the subject of general jurisdiction is brought within the autho rised area of provincial legislation.\\r\\nThis view thus leaves a field in which entry 2 could apply.\\r\\nWhen once the Provincial Legislature is found competent to make a law with respect to the general jurisdiction of courts, the apparent conflict with the 72 central legislative power under entry 53 of List I can be resolved in a given case by invoking the doctrine of pith and substance and incidental encroachment.\\r\\nFor, that rule, though not of much assistance in construing entries 1 and 2 which occur in the same List II, has its legitimate applica tion in ascertaining the true character of an enactment and attributing it to the appropriate list where the Federal and the Provincial Lists happen to overlap.\\r\\nAccordingly, if the Legislature of Bombay was, in conferring jurisdiction on the City Civil Court to hear and determine all suits of a civil nature, really legislating on a subject which was within the ambit of its legislative power, and if in doing so, it encroached on the forbidden field marked off by entry 53 of List 1, the encroachment should be taken to be only inciden tal.\\r\\nIt may be that such encroachment extends to the whole of that field, but that is immaterial, as pointed out by the Judicial Committee in the Khulna Bank case(1).\\r\\nOne of the questions their Lordships put to themselves in that case was \"Once it is determined that the pith and substance is money lending, is the extent to which the federal field is invaded a material matter?\" Answering the question in the negative their Lordships observed: \"No doubt it is an important matter, not, as their Lordships think, because the validity of an Act can be determined by discriminating between de grees of invasion, but for the purpose of determining what is the pith and substance of the impugned Act.\\r\\nIts provi sions may advance so far into the federal territory as to show that its true nature is not concerned with provincial matters, but the question is not, has its trespassed, more or less, but is the trespass, whatever it be, such as to show that the pith and substance of the impugned Act is not money lending but promissory notes or banking ? Once that question is determined, the Act falls on one or the other side of the line and can be seen as valid or invalid accord ing to its true content\".\\r\\nIn answering the objection that that view does not give sufficient effect to the words of precedence used in section 100 of the Government of (1) [1947] F.C.R.28.\\r\\n73 India Act as between the three Lists, their Lordships went on to say \"No doubt where they come in conflict List I has priority over Lists III and II, and List III has priority over List II; but the question still remains priority in what respect? Does the priority \\' of the Federal Legislature prevent the Provincial Legislature from dealing with any matter which may incidentally affect any item in its list or in each case has one to consider what the substance of an Act is and whatever its ancillary effect, attribute it to the appropriate list according to its true character ? In their Lordships \\' opinion the latter is the true view.\\r\\n\" The test for determining whether in pith and substance a particular enactment falls within one list or another is further elucidated in a passage quoted with approval from Lefroy \\'s Treatise on Canadian Constitutional Law in the judgment of the Federal Court in the Bank of Commerce case(1).\\r\\n\"It seems quite possible\" says the learned writer, summarising the effect of the Privy Council decisions on the point \"that a particular Act regarded from one aspect might be intra vires of a Provincial Legislature and yet regarded from another aspect might also be intra vires of the Domin ion Parliament.\\r\\nIn other words, what is properly to be called the subject matter of an Act may depend upon what is the true aspect of the Act.\\r\\nThe cases which illustrated this principle show.\\r\\nby \\'aspect \\' here must be understood the aspect or point of view of the legislator in legislating the object, purpose and scope of the legisla tion.\\r\\nThe word is used subjectively of the legislator rather than objectively of the matter legislated upon.\\r\\n\" Applying that test there can be little doubt that the im pugned Act must, in its pith and substance, be attributed to List II.\\r\\nas the legislators of Bombay were certainly not conferring on the new court, which they were constituting under the Act, jurisdiction with \\' respect to any of the matters in List I. They were, as section 3 clearly indi cates constituting a new court, the Bombay City Civil Court, and investing it with the (1) [1944] F.C.R.126,139. 10 74 general jurisdiction to try all suits of a civil nature within certain.\\r\\npecuniary and territorial limits, and if they were acting, as I have endeavoured to show, within the scope of the legislative power conferred on them under entry 2 read with entry 1 of List II, it seems immaterial that the enactment, so far as one aspect of jurisdiction, namely, its conferment, is concerned, encroaches practically on the whole of the federal field marked out by entry 53 of List I. The encroachment, however, would still leave ample room for the exercise by the Centre of its legislative power under entry 53 in regard to other aspects of jurisdiction and powers of courts.\\r\\nThis view is strongly reinforced by a consideration of the legislative practice prevailing in this country prior to the passing of the Government of India Act, 1935.\\r\\nThat it is legitimate to have regard to legislative practice in deter mining the scope of legislative powers has been recognised in decisions of high authority (e.g., Croft vs Dunphy) (1), It had long been the practice in this country to constitute and organise courts with general jurisdiction over all persons and matters subject only to certain pecuniary and territorial limitations, and to confer special jurisdiction limited to certain specified cases or matters either on the ordinary courts in addition to their general jurisdiction or on tribunals set up to deal with such matters exclusively.\\r\\nThe various Provincial Civil Court Acts as well as the provisions of the Civil and Criminal Procedure Codes invest the courts, both civil and criminal, with general jurisdic tion, that is to say, power to adjudicate in respect of all persons and all matters except those that are specifically excluded or brought within the cognisance of tribunals with special or limited jurisdiction extending only to those matters.\\r\\nThe grading of the courts too in their heirarchy has reference to the pecuniary and territorial limits rather than to the nature and kind of the subject matter which they are empowered to deal with.\\r\\nIt is reasonable to presume that this system of organisation of courts in (1) ,165 75 British India was known to the framers of the Government of India Act, 1935, and it cannot be readily supposed that they wanted to introduce a radical change by which the power of constituting courts and providing for administration of justice is to be vested in the Provincial Legislatures, while jurisdiction has to be conferred by piecemeal legisla tion by the Federal and Provincial Legislatures with respect to specific matters falling within their respective legisla tive fields which are by no means capable of c]ear demarca tion.\\r\\nThe constitutional puzzles which such a system is likely to pose to the legislatures no less than to the courts and the litigant public in the country whenever a new court is constituted in finding out by searching through the legislative lists, whether jurisdiction to deal with a particular matter or power to make a particular order is validly conferred by the appropriate legislature must make one pause and examine the relevant provisions of the Govern ment of India Act to see if there is anything in them to compel the acceptance of so novel a system.\\r\\nAfter giving the matter my careful consideration, I am convinced that both the language of the provisions and the antecedent legislative practice support the conclusion that the Provin cial Legislatures which have the exclusive power of consti tuting and organising courts and of providing for the admin istration of justice in their respective provinces, have also the power of investing the courts with general juris diction.\\r\\nOn the question whether section 4 of the Act operates as a delegation of legislative power, I entirely agree with the reasoning and conclusion of my learned brother Das who has said all I wish to say in his judgment which I have had the advantage of reading, and, like him, I reserve the larger question raised by the Attorney General as to how far it is open to the legislatures in this country, while acting within their authorised areas, to delegate their legislative powers to other agencies.\\r\\nI find it no more necessary in the present case to decide that point than in Jatindranath 76 Gupta \\'s case(I) where I preferred to rest my decision on a narrower ground.\\r\\nIt follows that the High Court has no jurisdiction :0 hear and determine the first respondent \\'s suit and I agree that the appeal should be allowed.\\r\\nMAHAJAN J. This is an appeal from the judgment of the High Court of Judicature at Bombay dated the 29th March, 1950, in Suit No. 240 of 1950, holding that section 4 of the Bombay City Civil Court Act (Bombay Act XL of 1948) is ultra vires the Provincial Legislature.\\r\\nThe facts are that on the 6th February, 1950, the first respondent presented a plaint to the Prothonotary and Senior Master of the High Court for filing a summary suit against the second respondent to recover a sum of Rs. 11,704 24 alleged to be due under promissory notes.\\r\\nThis suit was instituted in the High Court, in contravention of a notifi cation dated the 20th January, 1950, issued under section 4 of the City Civil Court Act, under which suits up to the pecuniary limit of Rs. 25,000 could be heard only by the City Civil Court, and not by the High Court.\\r\\nAs the question of jurisdiction was of importance, the matter was referred to the sitting Judge in Chambers.\\r\\nOn 23rd February, 1950, the learned Judge admitted the plaint holding that section 4 of the Act was ultra vires the Provincial Legislature and the notification issued under it was consequently inopera tive and that the High Court had jurisdiction to hear the suit.\\r\\nThe first respondent thereupon took out summons for judgment against the second respondent.\\r\\nOn the application of the AdvocateGeneral, the State of Bombay was impleaded as defendant at this stage and the proceedings were trans ferred to a Division Bench of the High Court.\\r\\nThe Division Bench upheld the view of the Judge in Chambers and returned the cause to him for disposal on the merits.\\r\\nThe State of Bombay, dissatisfied with this decision, has preferred the present appeal.\\r\\n(1) 77 Two questions have been canvassed in this appeal: (1) whether the City Civil Court Act is ultra vires the legisla ture of the Province of Bombay in so far as it deals with the jurisdiction and powers of the High Court and City Civil Court with respect to matters in List I of the Seventh Schedule of the Government of India Act, 1935; and (2) whether section 4 of the Act is void as it purports to delegate to the Provincial Government legislative authority in the matter of investing the City Civil Court with ex tended jurisdiction.\\r\\nBombay Act of 1948 came into force on 10th May, 1948.\\r\\nIt was considered expedient to establish an additional civil court for Greater Bombay presumably with the object of relieving congestion of work on the original side of the Bombay High Court.\\r\\nSections 3, 4 and 12 of the Act are in these terms : \"3.\\r\\nThe State Government may, by notification in the Official Gazette, establish for the Greater Bombay a court, to be called the Bombay City Civil Court.\\r\\nNotwithstanding anything contained in any law, such court shall have juris diction to receive, try and dispose of all suits and other proceedings of a civil nature not exceeding ten thousand rupees in value, and arising within the Greater Bombay, except suits or proceedings which are cognisable (a) by the High Court as a Court of Admiralty or Vice Admiralty or as a Colonial Court of Admiralty, or as a Court having testamentary, intestate or matrimonial jurisdiction, or (b) by the High Court for the relief of insolvent debt ors, or (c) by the High Court under any special law other than the Letters Patent, or (d) by the Small Cause Court: Provided that the State Government may, from time to time, after consultation with the High Court, by a like notifica tion extend the jurisdiction of the City Court to any suits or proceedings which are cognisable by the High Court as a court having testamentary or 78 ntestate jurisdiction or for the relief of insolvent debt ors.\\r\\nSubject to the exceptions specified in section a the State Government may by notification in the Official Ga zette, invest the City Court with jurisdiction to receive, try and dispose of all suits and other proceedings of a civil nature arising within the Greater Bombay and of such value not exceeding twenty five thousand rupees as may be specified in the notification.\\r\\nNotwithstanding anything contained in any law, the High Court shall not have jurisdiction to try suits and proceedings cognisable by the City Court: Provided that the High Court may, for any special rea son, and at any stage remove for trial by itself any suit or proceeding from the City Court.\\r\\n\" On the second question the High Court held that section 4 of the Act was inoperative as it purported to delegate the law making powers of the legislature to an outside authority and hence the notification issued in pursuance of it had no effect whatsoever and did not take away the jurisdiction of the High Court to try the present suit.\\r\\nOn the first ques tion the High Court placed reliance on its own earlier decision in Mulchand Kundanmal Jagtiani vs Raman Hiralal Shah(1), and held that the Act was intra vires the Bombay Legislature.\\r\\nThe appellant assails the correctness of the decision of the High Court on the second point and supports the decision on the first point.\\r\\nThe first respondent, on the other hand, while supporting the decision of the High Court on the second question, challenges its correctness in regard to the first question.\\r\\nThe learned Attorney General contends that the High Court placed an erroneous construc tion on sections 3 and 4 of the Act; that reading the two sections together the effect is that the legislature has set up the City Civil Court with an initial jurisdiction of Rs. 10,000 and has placed an outside limit of Rs. 25,000 on its pecuniary jurisdiction and that it (1) 79 has left to the discretion of the Provincial Government the determination of the circumstances under which this exten sion of the pecuniary jurisdiction between Rs. 10,000 to Rs. 25,000 is to take place.\\r\\nIt was said that section 4 is in the nature of a conditional legislation and that under it no legislative function has been delegated to the Provincial Government.\\r\\nThe learned Chief Justice in the court below disposed of this contention with the following,observations: \"I am also conscious of the fact that an Act must be construed in a manner which would reconcile its differ ent sections but with the best of intention in the world I do not see how it is possible to read sections 3 and 4 together so as to come to the conclusion for which the AdvocateGeneral contends.\\r\\nTo my mind it is patent that the Legislature never applied its mind to the question as to whether the new court which it was setting up should have a jurisdiction higher than that of Rs. 10,000.\\r\\nIt never passed any judgment on that question.\\r\\nIt never laid down any policy with regard to that question and section 4 is not a section which merely directs the Provincial Government to carry out the policy laid down by the legislature . but it is a section which confers upon the Provincial Gov ernment the power to confer jurisdiction upon the Court, or in other words, it is a section which entitled the Provin cial Government to lay down its policy as to whether the new Court should have the increased jurisdiction up to twenty five thousand rupees.\\r\\n\" I find it difficult to accept this view.\\r\\nWithout apply ing its mind to the question as to whether the new Court which it was setting up should have a jurisdiction higher than Rs. 10,000, how could the legislature possibly enact in section 4 that the pecuniary jurisdiction of the new court would not exceed Rs. 25,000.\\r\\nThe fixation of the maximum limit of the court \\'s pecuniary jurisdiction is the result of exercise of legislative will, as without arriving at this judgment it would not have been able to determine the out side limit of the pecuniary jurisdiction of the new 80 court.\\r\\nThe policy of the legislature in regard to the pecuniary jurisdiction of the court that was being set up was settled by sections 3 and 4 of the Act and it was to the effect that initially its pecuniary jurisdiction will be limited to Rs. 10,000 and that in future if circumstances make it desirable and this was left to the determination of the Provincial Government it could be given jurisdiction to hear cases up to the value of Rs. 25,000.\\r\\nIt was also determined that the extension of the pecuniary jurisdiction of the new court will be subject to the provisions contained in the exceptions to section 3.\\r\\nI am therefore of the opinion that the learned Chief Justice was not right in saying that the legislative mind was never applied as to the conditions subject to which and as to the amount up to which the new court could have pecuniary jurisdiction.\\r\\nAll that was left to the discretion of the Provincial Government was the determination of the circumstances under which the new court would be clothed with enhanced pecuniary jurisdiction.\\r\\nThe vital matters of policy having been determined, the actual execution of that policy was left to the Provincial Government and to such conditional legislation no exception could be taken.\\r\\nThe section does not empower the Provincial Government to enact a law as regards the pecuniary jurisdic tion of the new court and it can in no sense be held to be legislation conferring legislative power on the Provincial Government.\\r\\nIn Queen vs Burah(1), section 9 of Act XXII of 1869, which was a piece of legislation analogous to section 4 of the City Civil Court Act, was held intra vires by their Lordships of the Privy Council.\\r\\nBy the 9th section power was conferred on the Lieutenant Governor of Bengal to deter mine whether the Act or any part of it should be applied to certain districts.\\r\\nIn other words, authority to extend the territorial limits of the operation of the statute was conferred on the Lieutenant Governor and such extension had the result of depriving the High Court of its jurisdiction in those areas and of conferring jurisdiction in respect to them (1) 5 I.A. 178.\\r\\n81 on the commissioner.\\r\\nObjection was taken as to the validity of section 9 on the ground that it was legislation delegat ing legislative power and was therefore void, Their Lord ships negatived this contention and held that section 9 was intra vires the Governor General \\'s power to make laws and was a piece of conditional legislation.\\r\\nThat was a case of an extension of territorial limits within which an Act of the Legislature was to be in force, whereas the present is a case of extension of pecuniary limits of a court \\'s jurisdic tion.\\r\\nIn principle, there seems no difference between the two cases and the present case is therefore within the rule of the decision in Queen vs Burah(1).\\r\\nTheir Lordships in holding section9 intra vires made the following observations : \"Their Lordships think that it is a fallacy to speak of the powers thus conferred upon the Lieutenant Governor (large as they undoubtedly are) as if, when they were exer cised, the efficacy of the acts done under them would be due to any other legislative authority than that of the Gover nor, General in Council.\\r\\nTheir whole operation is, directly and immediately, under and by virtue of this Act (XXII of 1869) itself.\\r\\nThe proper Legislature has exercised its judgment as to place, person, laws, powers, and the result of that judgment has been to legislate conditionally as to all these things.\\r\\nThe conditions having been fulfilled, the legislation is now absolute.\\r\\nWhere plenary powers of legis lation exist as to particular subjects, whether in an Impe rial or in a Provincial Legislature, they may (in their Lordships \\' judgment) be well exercised, either absolutely or conditionally.\\r\\nLegislation, conditional on the use of particular powers, or on the exercise of a limited discre tion, entrusted by the Legislature to persons in whom it places confidence, is no uncommon thing; and, in many cir cumstances.\\r\\nit may be highly convenient.\\r\\nThe British Stat ute Book abounds with examples of it; and it cannot be supposed that the Imperial Parliament did not, when consti tuting the (1) 5 I A. 178, 11 82 Indian Legislature, contemplate this kind of conditional legislation as within the scrape of the legislative powers which it from time to time conferred.\\r\\ncertainly used no words to exclude it.\\r\\n\" These observations appositely apply to the legislative provision contained in section 4 of the impugned Act.\\r\\nThe true distinction is between the delegation of power to make the law which necessarily involves a discretion as to what it shall be and conferring authority or discretion as to its execution, to be exercised under and in pursuance of the law.\\r\\nObjection may be taken to the former but not to the latter.\\r\\nReference in this connection may also be made to the decision of the Supreme Court of America in Field vs Clark(1) wherein referring to Locke \\'s case(2) the following observations were made : \"To assert that a law is less than a law, because it is made to depend on a future event or act, is to rob the Legislature of the power to act wisely for the public wel fare whenever a law is passed relating to a state of affairs not yet developed, or to things future and impossible to fully know.\\r\\n\" The proper distinction the court said was this: \"The Legislature cannot delegate its power to make a law, but it can make a law to delegate a power to determine some fact or state of things upon which the law makes, or intends make, its own action depend.\\r\\nTo deny this would be to stop the wheels of government.\\r\\nThere are many things upon which wise and useful legislation must depend which cannot be known to the law making power, and, must there fore, be a subject of inquiry and determination outside of the halls of legislation.\\r\\n\" The High Court in support of its view placed considera ble reliance on the decision of the Federal Court in Jatin dra Nath Gupta vs The Province of Bihar(3) and it was con sidered that the present case fell1 within the ambit of the rule therein laid down.\\r\\nIt seems to me that the decision in the Bihar case has no application to the case in hand.\\r\\nThe Federal Court there was (1) 143 U.S.649.\\r\\n(3) [1949] F.C.R.595.\\r\\n(2) 72 Pa.491.\\r\\n83 dealing with an Act which contained the following provisions in section 1, sub section (3) : \"The Act shall remain in force for a period of one year from the date of its commencement: Provided that the Provincial Government may, by notifi cation, on a resolution passed by the Bihar Legislative Assembly and agreed to by the Bihar Legislative Council, direct that this Act shall remain in force for a further period of one year with such modifications, if any, as may be specified in the notification.\\r\\n\" In connection with this proviso I said in my judgment in that case that the power conferred therein was much larger than was conferred on the Lieutenant Governor in Queen vs Burah(1) inasmuch as it authorised the Provincial Government to modify the Act and also to re enact it.\\r\\nIt was pointed out that \"distinction between delegation of power to make the law which necessarily involves a discretion as to what it shall be, and conferring discretion or authority as to its execution to be exercised Under and in pursuance of the law is a true one and has to be made in all cases where such a question is raised.\\r\\n\" The following observations made by me there pointedly bring out the distinction between the two cases : \"The proviso which has been assailed in this case.\\r\\njudged on the above test, comes within the ambit of delegat ed legislation, and is thus an improper piece of legislation and is void.\\r\\nTo my mind, it not only amounts to abdication of legislative authority by the Provincial Legislature, it goes further and amounts to setting up a parallel Legisla ture for enacting a modified Bihar Maintenance of Public Order Act and for enacting a provision in it that that Act has to be enacted for a further period of one year.\\r\\nA careful analysis of the proviso bears out the above conclu sion.\\r\\nIt may be asked what does the proviso purport to do in terms and in substance ? The answer is that it empowers the Provincial Government to issue a notification saying (1) 5 I.A. 178.\\r\\n84 that the Provincial Act shall remain in force for a further period of one year with such modifications, if any, as may be specified in the notification .\\r\\nModification of statute amounts to re enacting it partially.\\r\\nIt involves the power to say that certain parts of it are no longer parts of the statute and that a statute with X sections is now enact ed with Y sections.\\r\\nIn the act of modification is involved a legislative power as a discretion has to be exercised wheth er certain parts of the statute are to remain law in future or not or have to be deleted from it.\\r\\nThe power to modify may even involve a power to repeal parts of it.\\r\\nA modified statute is not the same original statute.\\r\\nIt is a new Act and logically speaking, it amounts to enacting a new law.\\r\\n\" I have not been able to follow how these observations concerning the Bihar statute could be relied upon by the High Court in support of its decision in respect 10 the invalidity of section 4 of the Bombay City Civil Court Act.\\r\\nThe two provisions are not analogous in any manner whatsoev er and that being so, no support can be derived by the respondent from this decision.\\r\\nIn the concluding portion of his judgment under appeal the learned Chief Justice observed as follows: \" Now applying once more these tests to the City Civil Court Act, we find that the Legislature in the exercise of its legislative power has set up a Civil Court with a limit ed jurisdiction under section 5 of the Act.\\r\\nIt has not set up a court with jurisdiction higher than ten thousand rupees.\\r\\nHaving set up a court of limited jurisdiction it has given to the Provincial Government under section 4 the power to center upon that court a higher jurisdiction up to twen ty five thousand rupees.\\r\\nNow this power which is conferred upon the Provincial Government is a power which could only have been exercised by the Legislature itself.\\r\\n\" It seems to me that the above observations are based on a construction of sections 3 and 4 of the Act which these sections cannot legitimately bear.\\r\\nAs already observed.\\r\\nthe Legislature set up a Civil Court for Greater 85 Bombay and decided that, to start with, it will have pecuni ary jurisdiction up to Rs. 10,000.\\r\\nIt also decided at the same time that it would also have jurisdiction up to Rs. 25,000 as soon as circumstances, necessitate it the Provin cial Government was constituted the judge of those circum stances.\\r\\nWhat the limit of that jurisdiction was to be was in unmistakeable terms enacted in section 4 of the Act.\\r\\nIt was not left to the will of the Provincial Government to confer on that court any pecuniary jurisdiction that it liked to confer upon it.\\r\\nIt would be by force of the legis lative power of section 4 that the City Civil Court will be vested with enhanced jurisdiction but that vesting cannot take place till a notification is issued by the Provincial Government.\\r\\nIt is conditional on that event only.\\r\\nFor the reasons given above, in my judgment, the High Court was in error in holding that section 4 of the City Civil Court Act was void and ultra vires the Provincial legislature.\\r\\nIn this view the notification issued under section 4 must be held to be effective.\\r\\nThat being so, it is unnecessary to go into the question raised by the learned Attorney General that assuming that section 4 of the Act was delegation of legislative power, it was still valid.\\r\\nThe next question to decide is whether the Act is ultra vires the Bombay Legislature.\\r\\nIn order to appreciate Mr. Seervai \\'s contention on this point it is necessary to set out some of the provisions of the Government of India Act, 1935.\\r\\nrelevant to the enquiry.\\r\\nThese are contained in sec tion 100.\\r\\nand in the Seventh Schedule in entries 28 and 53 of List I, entries 1 and 2 of List II, and entries 4 and 15 of List III.\\r\\nThey are in these terms: Sec.\\r\\n(1) Notwithstanding anything in the two next succeeding sub sections, the Federal

Province.\\r\\nJurisdiction and powers of all courts except the Federal Court, with respect to any of the matters in this list.\\r\\nMr. Seervat contends that section 3 of the impugned Act is void because it directly trenches on the exclusive legis lative powers of the Centre conferred on it by List I of the Seventh Schedule inasmuch as \\'it confers jurisdiction on the new court in respect to all cases of a civil nature.\\r\\nThe expression \"all cases of a civil nature\" presumably brings within the ambit of the Act suits in respect to subjects contained in List I.\\r\\nHe urged that the three simi lar entries in the three is, name]y, entry 53 in List I, entry 2 in List II and entry 15 in List III indicated that in respect to the subjects covered by the three fields of legislation demarcated for the two Legislatures the Parlia ment empowered each of them respectively to make laws in respect to jurisdiction and power of courts and that in view of the provisions of section 100 of the Constitution Act the Provincial Legislature had no power to make any law confer ring jurisdiction on courts in respect to subjects covered by List I.\\r\\nIn other words, the Federal Legislature alone could legislate on the jurisdiction and powers of a court in regard to the subjects in List I. Similarly in respect of subjects contained in the Provincial List, jurisdiction and power of courts could only be determined by a law enacted by the Provincial Legislature and that in respect of items contained in List III, both Legislatures could make laws on the subject of jurisdiction and powers of courts.\\r\\nIt was said that the exceptions and the proviso to section 3 of the City Civil Court Act in dear terms disclosed that jurisdic tion in respect to the subjects on which the Provincial Legislature had no competence to legislate was also con ferred on the new court.\\r\\nSection \\'12 of the Act by which the High Court was deprived of all jurisdiction on matters that fell 88 within the jurisdiction of the City Civil Court was assailed on similar grounds.\\r\\nIn regard to the legislative power conferred under entry I of List 11 on the Provincial Legis lature it was contended that this wide power stood limited by the three entries above mentioned and that under it legislation could only be made to the extent of establishing and organizing courts but no legislation under it was per missible in respect to the powers of those courts.\\r\\nThe learned Attorney General, on the other hand, con tends that the Act is intra vires the Bombay Legislature under entry 1 of List II and under entries 4 \\' and 15 of List III, it having received the assent of the Governor General.\\r\\nIt was urged that the Provincial Legislature had exclusive legislative power on the subject of administration of jus tice and constitution and organization of all courts and that this power necessarily included the power to make a law in respect to the jurisdiction of courts established and constituted by it and that the impugned legislation in pith and substance being on the subject of administration of justice, it could not be held ultra vires even if it trenched on the field of legislation of the Federal Legisla ture.\\r\\nIn regard to entry 53 of List I, entry 2 of List II and entry 15 of List II of the Schedule, it was said that these conferred legislative power on the respective Legisla tures to confer special jurisdiction on established courts in respect of particular subjects only if it was considered necessary to do so.\\r\\nIn other words the argument was that the Provincial Government could create a court of general jurisdiction legislating under entry 1 of List II and that it was then open to both the Central and the Provincial Legislatures to confer special jurisdiction on courts in respect to particular matters that were covered by the respective lists.\\r\\nIn my opinion, the contention of the learned Attorney General that the Act is intra vires the Bombay Legislature under entry 1 of List If is sound and I am in respectful agreement with the view expressed by the Chief Justice of Bombay on this point in Mulchand Kundanmal Jagtiani vs Raman Hiralal 89 Shah (1).\\r\\nThe learned Chief Justice when dealing with this point said as follows: \"If, therefore, the Act deals with administration of justice and constitutes a court for that purpose and confers ordi nary civil jurisdiction upon it, in my opinion, the legis lation clearly falls within the legislative competence of the Provincial Legislature and is covered by item 1 of List 11 of Schedule 7.\\r\\nThat item expressly confers upon the Provincial Legislature the power to legislate with regard to the administration of justice and the constitution and organization of all courts except the Federal Court.\\r\\nIt is difficult to imagine how a court can be constituted without any jurisdiction, and if Parliament has made the adminis tration of justice exclusively upon the Provincial Legisla ture the power to constitute and organize all courts, it must follow, that the power is given to the Provincial Legislature to confer the ordinary civil jurisdiction upon the courts to carry on with their work.\\r\\nItem 2 of List II deals with jurisdiction and power of all courts except the Federal Court with respect to any of the matters in this list, and Mr. Mistree \\'s argument is that item 1 is limited and conditioned by item 2 and what he contends is that the only power that the Provincial Legislature has is undoubted ly to create courts, but to confer upon them only such jurisdiction as relates to items comprised in List II.\\r\\nI am unable to accept that contention or that interpretation of List 11 in Schedule 7.\\r\\nEach item in List 11 is an independ ent item, supplementary of each other, and not limited by each other in any way.\\r\\nItem 1 having given the general power to the Provincial Legislature with regard to all matters of administration of justice and with regard to the constitution and organization of all courts, further gives the power to the Legislature to confer special juris diction, if needs be, and special power, if needs be, to these courts with regard to any of the items mentioned in List 11.\\r\\nIt is impossible to read item 2 as curtailing (1) 12 90 and restricting the very wide power with regard to adminis tration of justice given to the Provincial \"Legislature under item 1.\\r\\nSimilarly in List I the Federal Legislature has been given the power under item 53 to confer jurisdic tion and power upon any court with regard to matters falling under any of the items in that list, and, therefore, it would be competent to the Federal Legislature to confer any special jurisdiction or power which it thought proper upon any court with regard to suits on promissory notes or mat ters arising under the Negotiable Instruments Act. \".\\r\\nIt seems to me that the legislative power conferred on the Provincial legislature by item 1 of List II has been con ferred by use Of language which is of the widest amplitude (administration of justice and constitution and organization of all courts).\\r\\nIt was not denied that the phrase employed would include within its ambit legislative power in respect to jurisdiction and power of courts established for the purpose of administration of justice.\\r\\nMoreover, the words appear to be sufficient to confer upon the Provincial Legis lature the right to regulate and provide for the whole machinery connected with the administration of justice in the PrOvince.\\r\\nLegislation on the subject administra tion of justice and constitution of courts of justice would be ineffective and incomplete unless and until the courts established under it were clothed with the jurisdiction and power to hear and decide causes.\\r\\nIt is difficult to visua lise a statute dealing with administration of justice and the subject of constitution and organization of courts without a definition of the jurisdiction and powers of those courts, as without such definition such a statute would be like a body without a soul.\\r\\nTo enact it would be an idle formality.\\r\\nBy its own force it would not have power to clothe a court with any power or jurisdiction whatsoever.\\r\\nIt would have to look to an outside authority and to another statute to become effective.\\r\\nSuch an enactment is, so far as I know, unknown to legislative practice and history.\\r\\nThe Parliament by making administration of justice a provin cial subject 91 could not be considered to have conferred power of legisla tion on the Provincial Legislature of an ineffective and useless nature.\\r\\nFollowing the line of argument taken by Mr. Mistree before the High Court of Bombay, Mr. Seervai stren uously contended that the only legislative power conferred on the Provincial Legislature by entry 1 of List II was in respect to the establishment of a court and its constitution and that no legislative power was given to it to make a law in respect to jurisdiction and power of the court estab lished by it.\\r\\nThe argument, logically analysed, comes to this: that a statute will contain the name of the court, the number of its judges, the method of their appointment, the salaries to be drawn by them and it will then stop short at that stage and will not include any provision defining the powers of the tribunal or its other jurisdiction and that the court so constituted could acquire jurisdiction only when a law was made relating to its jurisdiction and powers by the Federal Legislature under entry 53 of List I, by the Provincial Legislature under entry 2 of List II and by either Legisla ture under entry 15 of List III.\\r\\nThe learned counsel con tended that this peculiar result was the natural consequence of a federal constitution with divided powers, and that entries 53, 2 and 15 of the three respective lists limit and curtail the wide power conferred on the Provincial Legisla ture by item 1 of List II.\\r\\nIt is difficult to accede to this contention because it would amount to holding that though the Provincial Legislature under item 2 of List II has been given the widest power of legislation in the matter of administration of justice and constitution and Organiza tion of courts and though that field has been demarcated for it as its exclusive field of legislation, yet all that it can do, acting within that field, is merely to establish a court without any competency to function and that in can only become an effective instrument for administering jus tice by laws enacted elsewere or under powers conferred under other items of the different lists.\\r\\nI am unable to read items 53, 2 and 15 of the three respective 92 lists as imposing limitations on legislative power con ferred on the Province by item 1 of List II.\\r\\nSuch a con struction of the Act would not only do violence to the plain language of item 1 of List II but would be contrary to its scheme under which administration of justice was made a provincial subject.\\r\\nIt is significant that no other Legis lature has been given the power to bring into existence a court.\\r\\nA court without powers and jurisdiction would be an anomaly as it would not be able to discharge the func tion of administration of justice and the statute estab lishing such a court could not be said to be a law on the subject of administration of justice.\\r\\nIt is a fundamental principle of the construction of a constitution that every thing necessary for the exercise of powers is included in the grant of power.\\r\\nEverything necessary for the effective execution of power of legislation must therefore be taken to be conferred by the constitution with that power.\\r\\nIt may be observed that in exercise of legislative power under item 1 of List 11 a provincial Legislature can alter the constitu tion of the existing courts, can abolish them, reorganize them and can establish new courts.\\r\\nIf the construction contended for by Mr. Seervai is accepted, then the existing courts re established or re organised by the provincial Legislature would not be able to function till legislation under item 53 of List I, under item 2 of List II or item 15 of List III also simultaneously was made.\\r\\nI do not think that such a result was in the contemplation of parliament.\\r\\nMr. Seervai with some force argued that it full effect is given to the comprehensive phraseology employed in item 1 of List II, then it would result in making the provisions of item 2 of List II, of item 53 of List I and item 15 of List III nugatory.\\r\\nin other words, if the provincial Legislature could bring into existence a court of general jurisdiction which could hear all causes on subjects concerning which legislative power was divided in the three lists, then the conferment of legislative power on the Federal Legislature under item 53 of List 1, on the provincial Legislature under item 2 in List II and on both the Legislatures under 93 item 15 of List III was purposeless.\\r\\nIn my opinion, this argument is not a valid one and the premises on which it is based are not sound.\\r\\nThe three lists of subjects contained in Schedule 7 have not been drawn up with any scientific precision and the various items in them overlap.\\r\\nThe point kept in view in drawing up the lists was to see that all possible power of legislation was included ,within their ambit.\\r\\nBy making administration of justice a provincial subject and by conferring on the Provincial Legislature power to legislate on this subject and also on the subject of constitution and organization of courts, Parliament conferred on that Legislature an effective power which included within its ambit the law making power on the sub ject of jurisdiction of courts.\\r\\nThe Provincial Legislature could therefore bring into existence a court with general jurisdiction to administer justice on all matters coming before it within certain territorial and pecuniary limits, subject of course to the condition that such general juris diction may be expressly or impliedly taken away by the provisions of other laws.\\r\\nThe Parliament having divided the field of legislation between the two Legislatures, naturally thought that as a corollary or a necessary consequence of this division of legislative power it was necessary to provide by way of a complementary provision a legislative power specifically on the two Legislatures in respect to the jurisdiction and powers of courts on subjects which were within their exclusive legislative field.\\r\\nIf a Legislature could exclusively legislate in respect to particular sub jects, as a necessary consequence it should also have the power to legislate in respect to jurisdiction and power of the court dealing with that subject.\\r\\nIt is this power that has been conferred by entries 53, 2 and 15 above mentioned on the two Legislatures.\\r\\nEntries 42 and 99 of List I, entries 37 and 42 of List II and entries 25 and 36 of List III are of a similar consequential character.\\r\\nThe respective Legislatures are therefore competent to confer special powers on courts and can create special jurisdic tions acting under those powers in respect to 94 their divided fields of legislation.\\r\\nInstances of confer ment of powers and jurisdiction on courts to hear cases on particular subjects were well known to Parliament.\\r\\nSuch powers had been conferred on different courts in respect of testamentary and intestate jurisdiction, admiralty jurisdic tion, under the Indian Companies Act, under the Succession Act, Guardians and Wards Act and under the various.\\r\\nRent Acts and Acts dealing with relief of indebtedness.\\r\\nIn view of the division of powers in respect to different subjects, power was given under item 53 of List I, item 2 of last II and item 15 of List III to the different Legislatures when dealing with those subjects also to legislate on the ques tion of jurisdiction and powers of the courts.\\r\\nThis confer ment of legislative power to create special jurisdiction in respect to particular subjects does not in any way curtail the legislative power conferred on the Provincial Legisla ture under item 1 of List II.\\r\\nAs soon as special legisla tive power under item 53 of List I, under item 2 of List II and item 15 of List III is exercised, the causes that arise in respect to those subjects would then only be heard in jurisdictions created by those statutes and not in the courts of general jurisdiction entrusted with the normal administration of justice.\\r\\nIn the language of section 9 of the Code of Civil Procedure, jurisdiction of the general courts will then become barred by those statutes.\\r\\nI am therefore of the opinion that under item 1 of List II the Provincial Legislature has complete competence not only to establish courts for the administration of justice but to confer on them jurisdiction to hear all causes of a civil nature, and that this power is not curtailed or limit ed by power of legislation conferred on the two Legislatures under items 53, 2 and 15 of the three lists.\\r\\nOn the other hand, these three items confer on the respective Legisla tures power to legislate when dealing with particular sub jects within their exclusive legislative field to make laws in respect of jurisdiction and powers of courts that will be competent to hear causes relating to those subjects; in other words, this is a power of creating special 95 jurisdictions only.\\r\\nThis interpretation of the entries in the lists is not only in accordance with the scheme of the statute but it harmonizes the different entries in the lists and does not make any of them nugatory and in effective.\\r\\nThe interpretation contended for by Mr. Seervai would reduce the power of the Provincial Legislature under item 1 to almost nothingness.\\r\\nThe crux of the case is whether item 1 of List 11 should be given a limited construction which makes it nugatory or whether a limited construction is to be placed on items 53, 2 and 15 of the three lists.\\r\\nI have no hesitation in holding that both in the light of principles of construction of statutes and principles of legislation, the course to adopt is the one that I have indicated above.\\r\\nFinally, it was contended that section 12 of the Act in any case was a void piece of legislation as it deprived the High Court of its jurisdiction even in respect to subjects contained in List I of the Seventh Schedule.\\r\\nIn view of the construction that I have placed on item 1 of List II this argument has no force.\\r\\nIf the Legislature has power to bring into existence a court and confer jurisdiction and power on it, a fortiori it has power to take away the jurisdic tion and power that already exist in other courts.\\r\\nMore over, the Bombay City Civil Court Act in section a has excepted from the jurisdiction of the new court all cases which the High Court can hear under any special law.\\r\\nSpe cial law has been defined as a law applicable to a particu lar subject.\\r\\nIf under List 1 of the Seventh Schedule the Federal Legislature by any law determines that a case has to be heard by the High Court, section 5 will not affect the jurisdiction of that court in any manner whatsoever.\\r\\nThe result, therefore, is that the Bombay City Civil Court Act is a statute which is wholly within the legisla tive field of the Province under item 1 of List II and its validity cannot be affected even if it incidentally trenches on other fields of legislation.\\r\\nIt is not a statute dealing with any of the subjects mentioned in List I and therefore it cannot be said that the 96 Provincial Legislature has in any way usurped the power demarcated for the Centre.\\r\\nIn view of this conclusion I think it unnecessary to pronounce any opinion on the other points raised by the learned Attorney General.\\r\\nFor the reasons given above I allow the appeal preferred by the Government of Bombay and set aside the decision of the High Court holding that section 4 of the City Civil Court Act (XL of 1948) is void.\\r\\nIn the circumstances of the case I leave the parties t9 bear their own costs of the appeal.\\r\\nMUKHERJEA J.\\r\\nIn my opinion this appeal should be allowed and I concur substantially in the line of reasoning adopted by my learned brother Mahajan J. in his judgment.\\r\\nHaving regard to the constitutional importance of the questions raised in this case, I would desire to add some observations of mine own.\\r\\nThere are really two questions which require considera tion in this appeal.\\r\\nThe first is whether section 4 of the Bombay City Civil Court Act, 1948, is void and inoperative by reason of its amounting to a delegation of legisltive powers by the Provincial Legislature to the Provincial Government of Bombay.\\r\\nThe Bombay High Court has answered this question in the affirmative and it is entirely upon this ground that the judgment appealed against is based.\\r\\nThe propriety of this decision has been challenged by the learned Attorney General who appeared on behalf of the State of Bombay in support of this appeal.\\r\\nOn the other hand, Mr. Seervai, appearing on behalf of the respondents, has not only attempted to repel the contention ad vanced by the learned Attorney General, but has sought to support the judgment appealed against on another and a more comprehensive ground which, if accepted, would make the entire Bombay City Civil Court Act a void piece of legisla tion, as being an encroachment by the Provincial Legislature upon the field of legislation reserved for the Centre under List I of Schedule 7 to the Government of India Act, 1935.\\r\\n97 As regards the first point, I agree that the contention of the appellant is sound and must prevail.\\r\\nI have no hesi tation in holding that the Legislature in empowering the Provincial Government to invest the City Court, by notifica tion, with jurisdiction of such value not exceeding Rs. 25,000 as may be specified in the Notification, has not delegated its legislative authority to the Provincial Gov ernment.\\r\\nThe provision relates only to the enforcement of the policy which the Legislature itself has laid down.\\r\\nThe law was full and complete when it left the legislative chamber permitting the Provincial Government to increase the pecuniary jurisdiction of the City Court up to a certain amount which was specified in the Statute itself.\\r\\nWhat the Provincial Government is to do is not to make any law; it has to execute the will of the Legislature by determining the time at which and the extent to which, within the limits fixed by the Legislature, the jurisdiction of the court should be extended.\\r\\nThis is a species of conditional legis lation which comes directly within the principle enunciated by the Judicial Committee in The Queen vs Burah(1), where the taking effect of a particular provision of law is made to depend upon determination of certain facts and conditions by an outside authority.\\r\\nThe learned Judges of the Bombay High Court in coming to their decision on the point seem to have been influenced to some extent by the pronouncement of the Federal Court in Jatindranath Gupta vs Province of Bihar(2), and the learned.\\r\\nCounsel for the respondents naturally placed reliance upon it.\\r\\nI was myself a party to the majority decision in that case and expressed my views in a separate judgment.\\r\\nI do not think that there is anything in my judgment which lends support to the contention which the respondents have put forward.\\r\\nI stated expressly in course of, my Judgment on the authority of the well known American decision in Locke \\'s appeal(3) that a legislature may not (1) 5 I.A. 178.\\r\\n(3) 13 American Reports 716.\\r\\n13 98 delegate its powers to make law but \"it can make a law to delegate a power to determine some fact or state of things upon which the law makes or intends to make its own action depend \"; and that the inhibition against delegation does not extend to legislation which is complete in itself, though its operation is made to depend upon contingencies the ascertainment of which is left to an external body.\\r\\nThe subject matter of dispute in the Bihar case was the validity of a proviso engrafted upon section 1, subsection (3) of the Bihar Maintenance of Public Order Act.\\r\\nThe sub section laid down that the Act would remain in force for a period of one year from the date of its commencement.\\r\\nThe proviso then added \"that the Provincial Government may, by notification on a resolution passed by the Bihar Legislative Assembly and agreed to by the Bihar Legislative Council direct that this Act shall remain in force for a further period of one year with such modifications, if any, as may be specified in the notification.\" Mr. Seervai would have been probably right in invoking the decision in that case as an authority in his favour if the proviso simply empowered the Provincial Government, upon compliance with the condi tions prescribed therein, to extend the duration of the Act for a further period of one year, the maximum period being fixed by the Legislature itself.\\r\\nThe proviso, however, went further and authorised the Provincial Government to decide at the end of the year not merely whether the Act should be continued for another year but whether the Act itself was to be modified in any way or not.\\r\\nIt was conceded by the learned Counsel appearing for the Province of Bihar that to authorise another body to modify a statute amounts to in vesting that body with legislative powers.\\r\\nWhat the learned Counsel contended for, was that the power of modification was severable from the power of extending the duration of the statute and the invalidity of one part of the proviso should not affect its other part.\\r\\nTo this contention my answer was that the two provisions were inter related in such a manner in the statute that one could not be severed from the other.\\r\\n99 Obvious]y, the facts of this case are quite different, and all that I need say with regard to my pronouncement in Jatindranath Gupta \\'s case is that the principle upon which that case was decided is not applicable and cannot be at tracted, to the present case.\\r\\nI may state here that a question in the broad form as to whether a Provincial Legislature exercising its legislative powers within the limits prescribed by the Imperial Parlia ment in the Government of India Act, 1935, could delegate its legislative functions in any manner to an outside au thority as it thought proper, was neither raised nor decided in Jatindranath Gupta \\'s case.\\r\\nThe learned Attorney General has not very properly invited any final decision on that point in the present case and I would refrain from express ing any opinion upon it. \\' The second point appears to be of some complexity and it was decided by the Bombay High Court adversely to the re spondents on the basis of an earlier pronouncement of the same Court in Mulchand vs Raman(1).\\r\\nThe arguments of Mr. Seervai are really directed at assailing the correctness of this earlier decision which the learned Judges held to be binding on them in the present case.\\r\\nThe contention of Mr. Seervai, in substance, is, that the Bombay City Civil Court Act, which is a piece of provincial legislation, is ultra vires the legislature inasmuch as it purports to endow the City Court, which it brings into existence, with jurisdic tion to receive, try and dispose of \"all suits and other proceedings of a civil nature\" with certain exceptions that are specified in the different sub sections of section 8.\\r\\nWhat is said is that the expression \"all suits of a civil nature\" is wide enough to include suits in respect to mat ters specified in List I of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution Act with regard to which the Central Legisla ture alone is competent to confer jurisdiction on courts under entry 53 of the said List.\\r\\nIt is argued that so far as the Provincial Legislature is concerned, it may empower all courts (except the Federal Court) with jurisdiction in respect to any of the matters in the Provincial List.\\r\\n(1) 100 and it may also be capable of exercising like powers in regard to subjects enumerated in the Concurrent List as provided for in article 15 of List III, subject to the conditions laid down in section 107 of the Act.\\r\\nBut as the scope of section 3 of the Bombay City Civil Court Act is not limited to matters in Lists II and III only and its language can embrace subjects coming under List I as well, and fur thermore as the different subjects both within and outside the provincial and concurrent fields dealt with by section 3 are inextricably, intertwined and not capable of severance or demarcation, the whole Act must be held to be ultra vires.\\r\\nIn answer to this, it has been urged by the learned Attorney General that amongst the subjects included in Item 1 of the Provincial List are \"the administration of justice and constitution and organization of all courts except the Federal Court\", and these expressions obviously include within their ambit the conferring of general jurisdiction to hear and decide cases upon courts which are set up by the Provincial Legislature, and without which they cannot func tion as courts at all. \\'It is said that Item 2 of the Provincial List which mentions \"jurisdiction and powers of all courts except the Federal Court with respect to any of the matters in this List\" does not in any way limit or curtail the ordinary connotation of the ,expressions \"admin istration of justice and constitution of courts\" as used in Item I of the said List referred to above.\\r\\nIt cannot be disputed that the words \"administration of justice\" occuring in Item 1 of the Provincial List, unless they are limited in any way, are of sufficient amplitude to confer upon the Provincial Legislature the right to regulate and provide for the whole machinery connected with the administration of justice.\\r\\nSection 92, of the North America Act deals with the exclusive powers of the Provincial Legis latures and clause (14) of the section speaks of \"the admin istration of justice in the Provinces\" as including \"the constitution, maintenance and organization of Provincial Courts.\\r\\n\" In interpreting this provision of the constitution it has been held in North America that the words 101 \"constitution, maintenance and organization of courts\" plainly include the power to define the jurisdiction of such courts territorially as well as in other respects(2).\\r\\nMr. Seervai argues that this might be the normal meaning of the words if they stood alone.\\r\\nBut if Items 1 and 2 of the Provincial List are read together, the conclusion cannot be avoided that the expressions \"administration of justice and constitution of courts\" do not include \"jurisdiction and powers of courts\" which are separately dealt with under Item 2.\\r\\nTo find out, therefore, the extent of powers of the Provincial Legislature in respect conferring jurisdic tion upon courts, the relevant item to be looked to is not Item 1 but Item 2 of the Provincial List.\\r\\nThe contention in this form seems to me to be plainly unacceptable.\\r\\nI agree with Mr. Setalvad that the different topics in the same Legislative List should not be read as exclusive of one another.\\r\\nAs was observed by Sir Maurice Gwyer in The United Provinces vs Atiqa Begum(1), \"the sub jects dealt with in the three Legislative Lists are not always set out with scientific definition.\\r\\nIt would be practically impossible for example to define each item in the Provincial List in such a way as to make it exclusive of every other item in that List, and Parliament seems to have been content to take a number of comprehensive categories and to describe each of them by a word of broad and general import .\\r\\nI think that none of the items in the List is to be read in a narrow or restricted sense, and that each general word should be held to extend to all ancillary or subsidiary matters which can fairly and reasonably be said to be comprehended in it.\\r\\n\" As there can be no question of conflict between two items in the same List, there is no warrant for restricting the natural meaning of one for the simple reason that the same subject might in some aspect come within the purview of the other.\\r\\nThe difficulty, however, arises when we come to entry 53 of List I.\\r\\nUnder this entry, it is the Central (1) Re County Courts of British, Columbia 21 S.C.R. 446.\\r\\n(2) at p. 134. 102 Legislature that has been given the power of legislating in regard to jurisdiction and powers of all courts except the Federal Court in respect to any of the matters in List L The difficulty that one is confronted with, is that if Item 1 of the Provincial List is taken to empower the Provincial Legislature to invest a court with jurisdiction with respect to all subjects no matter in whichever List it might occur, a clear conflict is bound to arise between Item 1 of the Provincial List and Item 53 of the Central List; and a Provincial legislation trespassing upon the exclusive field of the Centre would be void and inoperative under section 100 of the Constitution Act.\\r\\nThis being the posi tion, a way would have to be found out to avoid the conflict.\\r\\nAs the Privy Council observed in the case of the Citizens Insurance Company of Canada vs Parsons(2) \"it could not have been the intention that a conflict should exist and in order to prevent such a result the two sections must be read together and the language of the one interpreted and where necessary modified by the other.\" Mr. Seervai suggests that the proper way of reconciling this apparent conflict would be to read the words \"adminis tration of justice and constitution of courts\" occurring in entry 1 of the Provincial List as exclusive of any matter relating to jurisdiction of courts.\\r\\nThe Provincial Legisla ture can only set up or constitute courts but their juris diction or power of deciding cases must be derived from the Central or the Provincial Legislature or, from either of them in accordance with the subjects to which such juris diction relates.\\r\\nThe Provincial Legislature can endow the court with jurisdiction in respect to any matter in List II and the Central Legislature can do the same with regard to subjects specified in List I. So far as matters in the Concurrent List are concerned, either of the Legislatures can make provisions in respect of them subject to the condi tions laid down in section 107 the Constitution Act.\\r\\n(2).A.C. ,96 at p. 109.\\r\\n103 This argument, though apparently plausible, cannot, in my opinion, be accepted as sound.\\r\\nIt is to be noted that the right to set up courts and to provide for the whole machinery of administration of justice has been given exclu sively to the Provincial Legislature.\\r\\nUnder section 101 of the North America Act, the Parliament of Canada has a re serve of power to create additional courts for better admin istration of the laws of Canada but the Indian Constitution Act of 1935 does not give any such power to the Central Legislature.\\r\\nCourts are to be established by the Provincial Legislature alone.\\r\\nThe word \\'court \\' certainly means a place where justice is judicially administered, The appointment of Judges and officers or the mere setting apart of a place where the Judges are to meet, are not sufficient to consti tute a court.\\r\\nA court cannot administer justice unless it is vested with jurisdiction to decide cases and \"the consti tution of a court necessarily includes its jurisdiction.\\r\\n\"(1) If Mr. Seervai \\'s contention is accepted, the result will be that when a Provincial Legislature estab lishes a civil court, it can only be invested with jurisdic tion to decide cases in respect to matters coming within the Provincial List.\\r\\nSuch court can have no power to decide cases relating to any matter which is enumerated in List I so long as the appropriate Legislature does not confer upon it the requisite authority.\\r\\nThus an ordinary Provincial Court established to decide civil suits would be entitled to entertain all money claims but not a claim on a promissory note; nor could it entertain a suit for recovery of corpora tion tax, for Negotiable Instruments and corporation tax are subjects of the Central List.\\r\\nThis certainly was not the scheme of the Constitution Act.\\r\\nIn my opinion, the proper way to avoid a conflict would be to read entry 1 of the Provincial List, which contains the only provision relating to constitution of courts and administration of justice, along with the group of three entries, viz., entry 53 of List I, entry 2 of List II and entry 15 of List III with which it is supposed to be in conflict, (1) Vide Clement \\'s Canadian Consitution, 3rd Edn., p. 527, 104 and to interpret the language of one by that of the other.\\r\\nEntry 1 of List II uses the expressions \"administration of justice and constitution of all courts\" in a perfectly general manner.\\r\\nNo particular subject is specified to which the administration of justice might relate or for which a court might be constituted.\\r\\nIt can, therefore, be legitimately interpreted to refer to a general jurisdiction to decide cases not limited to any particular subject.\\r\\nThe other three items on the other hand relate to particular matters appearing in the three Lists and what they contem plate is the vesting of jurisdiction in courts with regard to such specific items only.\\r\\nIn one case the jurisdiction is \\'general \\' as is implied in the expression \"administration of justice\", while in the other three the jurisdiction is \\'particular \\' as limited to particular matters and hence exclusive.\\r\\nI agree with my learned brother Patanjali Sastri J. that one approved way of determining the scope of a legislative topic is to have regard to what has been ordi narily treated as embraced within that topic in the legisla tive practice of the country(2); and if that test is ap plied, the interpretation suggested above would appear to be perfectly legitimate.\\r\\nThe distinction between general and particular jurisdiction has always been recognised in the legislative practice of this country prior to the passing of the Constitution Act of 1935 and also after that.\\r\\nThere have been always in this country civil courts of certain classes and categories graded in a certain manner according to their pecuniary jurisdiction and empowered to entertain and decide all suits of a civil nature within particular localities.\\r\\nParticular jurisdiction again have been conferred on some one or the other of these courts to try cases relating to certain specified matters.\\r\\nThus there have been special jurisdictions created for insolvency, probate or guardianship proceedings, for deciding disputes relating to compulsory acquisition of land and for dealing with cases arising under the Rent Acts or the different legislations passed in recent years (2) vide Croft vs Dunphy.\\r\\n105 for scaling down exorbitant rates of interest or giving relief to rural debtors.\\r\\nSimilar instances may be cited with regard to conferring of special jurisdiction in criminal cases.\\r\\nThere will be no difficulty in interpreting in a proper manner the different entries in the Legislative Lists re ferred to above if this distinction between general and special jurisdiction is kept in view.\\r\\nThe entire scheme of the Constitution Act of 1935 is to vest the power of estab lishing courts upon the Provincial Legislature.\\r\\nThe Provin cial Legislature can endow the courts which it sets up with general jurisdiction to decide all cases which, according to the law of the land, are triable in a court of law, and all these powers can be exercised under entry I of List II.\\r\\nIf the Central Legislature or the Provincial Legislature chooses to confer special jurisdiction on certain courts in respect to matters enumerated in their appropriate legisla tive lists, they can exercise such powers under the three entries specified above.\\r\\nBut the exercise of any such powers by the Central Government would not m any way conflict with the powers exercisable by the Provincial Legislature under entry 1 of List II.\\r\\nThe expression \\'general \\' must always be understood as being opposed to what is \\'special \\' or exclu sive.\\r\\nIf the Central Legislature vests any particular juris diction upon a court in respect to a Central matter, that matter would cease to be a general matter and consequently the court having general jurisdiction would no longer deal with that, but the general jurisdiction of such courts would not be affected thereby.\\r\\nThe contents of general jurisdic tion are always indeterminate and are not susceptible of any specific enumeration.\\r\\nIn this view, I do not think that it would be at all necessary to invoke \\'the pith and substance \\' doctrine in avoiding the possibility of incidental encroach ment by the Provincial Legislature upon Central subjects in regard to conferring jurisdiction upon courts.\\r\\nIf the expression \\'jurisdiction \\' in entry 53 of List I means and refers to special jurisdiction only, there cannot be even an incidental encroachment upon such special jurisdiction 14 106 by reason of the conferring of general jurisdiction upon courts by the Provincial Legislature under entry 1 of List II.\\r\\nAs I have said already what is \\'special \\' or made so, will automatically cease to be in the category of what is \\'general \\' and no question of a conflict would at all arise.\\r\\nIt may be pointed out in this connection that in the Canadian Constitution also, the general scheme is to carry on administration of justice throughout Canada through the medium of provincial courts.\\r\\nSubject to the residuary power reserved to the Dominion Parliament under section 101 of the North America Act, the Constitution has assigned to the provinces the exclusive power in relation to administration of justice including the maintenance, constitution and organization of courts.\\r\\nThere is no limitation in any provincial court along the line of division that exists between matters within the legislative competence of the Dominion Parliament and of the Provincial Legislative Assemblies (1).\\r\\nThere is indeed no such thing as Entry 53 in List I of the Indian Act in the Canadian Constitution, but there are judicial pronouncements to the effect that the Dominion Parliament can impose jurisdiction on provincial courts over Dominion subjects (2).\\r\\nIt may be that the British Parliament in framing the legislative topics in the Government of India Act of 1935 in regard to administration of justice and jurisdiction of courts wanted to adopt the Canadian model with such modifications as they considered necessary.\\r\\nIt is, however, immaterial to speculate on these matters.\\r\\nFor the reasons given above, I am of the opinion that the decision of the Bombay High Court in Mulchand vs Raman(3) is correct, and the contention of Mr. Seervai should fail.\\r\\nIn the result, the appeal is allowed and the judgment of the High Court is set aside.\\r\\nDAS J: I agree that this appeal should be allowed.\\r\\nIn view of the importance of the questions raised in (1) Vide Clement \\'s Canadian Constitution p. 526.\\r\\n(2) Vide Lefroy \\'s Canada \\'s Federal system p. 541, (3) 107 this appeal, I consider it right to state \\'my reasons for coming to that conclusion.\\r\\nThe salient facts, as to which there is no dispute, are as follows: On May 10, 1948, the Provincial Legislature of Bombay passed Act No. XL of 1948, called the Bombay City Civil Court Act, 1948.\\r\\nIt was passed with a view \"to estab lish an additional Civil Court for Greater Bombay.\\r\\n\" The provisions of that Act which will be relevant for the pur poses of the present appeal may now be set out: \"1.\\r\\n(2) It shall come into force on such date as the Provincial Government may, by notification in the Official Gazette, appoint in this behalf.\\r\\nThe Provincial Government may, by notification in the Official Gazette, establish for the Greater Bombay a Court, to be called the Bombay City Civil Court.\\r\\nNotwith standing anything contained in any law, such Court shall have jurisdiction to receive, try and dispose of all suits and other proceedings of a civil nature not exceeding ten thousand rupees in value, and arising within the Greater Bombay, except suits or proceedings which are cognizable (a) by the High Court as a Court of Admiralty or Vice Admiralty or as a Colonial Court of Admiralty, or as a Court having testamentary, intestate or matrimonial jurisdiction, or (b) by the High Court for the relief of insolvent debt ors, or (c) by the High Court under any special law other than the Letters Patent, or (d) by the Small Cause Court: Provided that the Provincial Government may, from time to time, after consultation with the High Court, by a like notification extend the jurisdiction of the City Court to any suits or proceedings of the nature specified in Clauses (a) and (b).\\r\\nSubject to the exceptions specified in section 3, the Provincial Government may, by notification in the Offi cial Gazette, invest the City Court with jurisdiction to receive, try and dispose of all suits and 108 other proceedings of a civil nature arising within the Greater Bombay and of such value not exceeding twenty five thousand rupees as may be specified in the notification.\\r\\nNotwithstanding anything contained in any law, the High Court shall not have jurisdiction to try suits and proceedings cognizable by the City Court: Provided that the High Court may, for any special rea son, and at any stage, remove for trial by itself any suit or proceeding from the City Court.\\r\\n\" The Act received the assent of the Governor General about the same time.\\r\\nIt came into force on August 16, 1948, by a notification issued by the Provincial Government and published in the Official Gazette.\\r\\nSimultaneously with the passing of the above Act the Bombay Legislature also enacted Act (XLI of 1948) called the Bombay High Court Letters Patent Amendment Act, 1948.\\r\\nBy section3 of that Act Clause 12 of the Letters Patent was amended by adding the following words: \"Except that the said High Court shall not have such Original jurisdiction in cases falling within the jurisdic tion of the Small Cause Court at Bombay or the Bombay City Civil Court.\\r\\n\" Shortly after the passing of the above Acts, the validi ty of the Bombay City Civil Court Act (XL of 1948) was challenged in Mulchand Kundanmal Jagtiani vs Raman Hiralal Shah(1), a suit on promissory notes filed in the Original side of the High Court.\\r\\nA Division Bench of the Bombay High Court (Chagla C.J. and Bhagwati J.), on September 2, 1948, held that the Act was well within the legislative competence of the Provincial Legislature and was not ultra vires.\\r\\nLeave was given to the plaintiff in that suit under section 205 of the Government of India Act, 1935, to appeal to the Federal Court but no such appeal appears to have been filed.\\r\\nOn January 20, 1950, the Provincial Government of Bombay issued the following notification No. 2346/5 in the Official Gazette: (1) A,I.R. 1949 Bom.\\r\\n197; 109 \"In exercise of the powers conferred by section 4 of the Bombay City Civil Court Act, 1948 (Bombay, Act XL of 1948), the Government of Bombay is pleased to invest, with effect from and on the date of this notification, the City Court with jurisdiction to receive, try and dispose of all suits and other proceedings of a civil nature not exceeding twen ty five thousand rupees in value, and arising within the Greater Bombay subject, however, to the exceptions specified in section a of the said Act.\\r\\n\" On February 6, 1950, the first respondent Narothamdas Jethabhai presented a plaint before the Prothonotary of the Bombay High Court for recovery of Rs. 11,704 5 4 with further interest due by the second respondent Aloysious Pinto Phillips upon three several promissory notes.\\r\\nIn paragraph 4 of this plaint it was expressly pleaded that the High Court had jurisdiction to receive, try and dispose of that suit because (1)the Bombay City Civil Court Act, 1048, was ultra vires and (2) at least section 4 of that Act and the notification issued thereunder were ultra vires.\\r\\nHaving some doubts as to whether in view of the notification issued 1 by the Provincial Government under section 4 of the Act the plaint could be admitted in the High Court, the Prothon otary placed the matter under the rules of the Court before Bhagwati J. who was then the Judge in Chambers.\\r\\nBy his judgment delivered on February 23, 1950, Bhagwati J. held that section 4 of the Act and the notification issued there under were ultra vires and void and that the High Court, therefore, had jurisdiction to entertain the suit.\\r\\nThe plaint was accordingly received and admitted.\\r\\nThe first respondent thereupon took out a summons under the rules of the Court for leave to sign judgment against the second respondent.\\r\\nThe State of Bombay was, on its own application, added as a party to the suit.\\r\\nThe matter was put up before a Division Bench (Chagla C.J. and Tendolkar J.) for trial of the following issues: 110 \"(1) Whether Act XL of 1948 is ultra vires of the Legis lature of the State of Bombay.\\r\\n(2) Whether,Section 4 of Act XL of 1948 is in any event ultra rites of the Legislature of the State of Bombay.\\r\\n(3) Whether the Government of Bombay Notification \\'No. 2346/5 dated 20th January, i1950, is ultra vires, void and inoperative in law.\\r\\n(4) Whether this Court has jurisdiction to try the suit.\\r\\nThe larger point involved in issue No. 1 having been concluded by the earlier decision of the Division Bench in Mulchand Kundanmal Jagtiani vs Raman Hiralal Shah(1) that issue was answered in the negative without any argument but leave was reserved to the first respondent to contest the correctness of that earlier decision in this Court.\\r\\nThe Division Bench in agreement with Bhagwati J. held that by section 4 of the Act the Provincial Legislature did not itself legislate but delegated the power of legislation to the Provincial Government which it had no power to do and, therefore, section 4 and along with it the notification No. 2346/5 issued thereunder were ultra vires, void and inoperative.\\r\\nAccordingly they answered issues Nos.\\r\\n(2), (3) and (4)in the affirmative and sent the summons for judgment back to the learned Judge taking miscellaneous matters to dispose it of on merits.\\r\\nThe State of Bombay has now come up before us in appeal from this decision of the High Court.\\r\\nThe Advocate General of Madras has intervened in support of this appeal and for maintaining the validity of the Madras City Civil Court Act (VII of 1892) section 3A of which inserted in 1935 by way of amendment is in identical terms with section 4 of the Bombay Act except that the amount of the value was fixed at Rs. 10,000 in section 3A of the Madras Act instead of Rs. 25,000 fixed in section 4 of the Bombay Act.\\r\\nThe distinction between conditional legislation and delegation of legislative power has been well known (1) 51 Bom L R.86 111 ever since the decision of the Privy Council in R.v. Burah(1) and the other Privy Council cases cited in the judgments of the High Court.\\r\\nIt is firmly established that conditional legislation is not only permissible but is indeed in many cases convenient and necessary.\\r\\nThe difficul ty which confronts the Courts is in ascertaining whether a particular provision of a Statute constitutes a conditional legislation as explained in the decisions of the Privy Council.\\r\\nIn the present case the High Court, on a construc tion of section 4 of the Bombay City Civil Court Act, came to the conclusion that it was not an instance of conditional legislation at all.\\r\\nThe use of the word \"invest\" in section 4 was considered by the High Court to be very significant and the difference between the language in section 3 and that in section 4 appeared to them to be very marked and striking.\\r\\nAccording to the High Court while by section a the Legislature itself set up a Court with a particular pecuniary jurisdiction, under section 4 the Legislature itself did not invest the Court with any higher jurisdiction but left it to the Provincial Government to exercise the function which the Government of India Act laid down should be exercised by the Provincial Legislature.\\r\\nThe learned Chief Justice expressed the view that the Legislature never applied its mind to the question as to whether the new Court which it was setting up should have a jurisdiction higher than that of Rs. 10,000, and that section 4 was not a sec tion which merely directed the Provincial Government to carry out the policy laid down by the Legislature, but that it was a section which conferred upon the Provincial Govern ment the power to confer jurisdiction upon the Court.\\r\\nThen, after referring to R.V. Baruha(1) and several other cases and purporting to apply the tests laid down in the decisions to the Act the learned Chief Justice concluded that the Legislature in the exercise of its legislative power had set up a Civil Court with a limited jurisdiction under section a of the Act, that it had not set up a Court with a jurisdiction higher than ten thousand rupees and (1) L.R 5 I. A. 178.\\r\\n112 that, having set up a Court of, limited jurisdiction, it had given to the Provincial Government under section 4 the power to confer upon that Court a higher jurisdiction up to twenty five thousand rupees.\\r\\nThis power, which was con ferred upon the Provincial Government was according to the Chief Justice, a power which could only have been exercised by the Legislature itself.\\r\\nI am unable to accept the afore mentioned construction of sections 3 and 4 of the Act.\\r\\nAs I have already said, the High Court rounded their conclusions principally on the observations of their Lord ships of the Privy Council in R.v. Burah(1) and certain other Privy Council cases.\\r\\nIt will be useful, therefore, to analyse the Privy Council decision in R.v. Burah(1).\\r\\nIn 1869 the Indian Legislature passed an Act (No. XXII of 1869) purporting, first, to remove a district called Garo Hills from the jurisdiction of the Courts of civil and criminal jurisdiction and from the law prescribed for such Courts by Regulations and Acts and, secondly, to vest the administra tion of civil and criminal justice, within the same territo ry, in such officers as the Lieutenant Governor of Bengal might, for the purpose of tribunals of first instance, or of reference and appeal, from time to time appoint.\\r\\nThe Act was to come into operation on such day as the Lieutenant Governor of Bengal should, by notification in the Calcutta Gazette, direct.\\r\\nThe 8th section authorised the Lieuten ant Governor of Bengal by notification in the Calcutta Gazette to extend to the said territory, any law or any portion of any law then in force in other territories sub ject to his government or which may thereafter be enacted by the Council of the Governor General or of himself.\\r\\nThe 9th section of that Act provided: \"The said Lieutenant Governor may from time to time, by notification in the Calcutta Gazette, extend mutatis mutan dis all or any of the provisions contained in the other sections of this Act to the Jaintia Hills, the Naga Hills, and to such portion of the Khasi Hills, as for the time being forms part of British India, (1) L.R. 5 I.A. 178.\\r\\n113 Every such notification shall specify the boundaries of the territories to which it applies.\\r\\n\" On October 14, 1871, the Lieutenant Governor of Bengal issued a notification in exercise of the powers conferred on him by section 9 extending the provisions of that Act to the territory known as the Khasi and Jaintia Hills and excluded therefrom the jurisdiction of the Courts of civil and crimi nal justice.\\r\\nThe respondent Burah and another person having been convicted by the Deputy Commissioner of the Khasi and Jaintia Hills of murder and sentenced to death, which was later on commuted to transportation for life, they from jail sent a petition of appeal against their conviction.\\r\\nThe provisions of Act XXII of 1869 having been extended, by notification under section 9, to the Khasi and Jaintia Hills, the High Court would have no jurisdiction to enter tain the appeal, unless section 9 and the notification were ultra rites and void.\\r\\nThe majority of the Judges of the Full Bench constituted for considering the question took the view that section 9 was really not legislation but was an in stance of delegation of legislative power.\\r\\nThe Crown ob tained special leave to appeal to the Privy Council.\\r\\nIn summarising the effect of the provisions of sections 1 to 8 of that Act on Garo Hills Lord Selborne who delivered the judgment of the Privy Council observed at page 194 that the Governor General in council had determined, in the due and ordinary course of legislation, to remove a particular district from the jurisdiction of the ordinary Courts and offices, and to place it under new Courts and offices, to be appointed by and responsible to the Lieutenant Governor of Bengal leaving it to the Lieutenant Governor to say at what time that change should take place, that the Legisla ture had determined that, so far, a certain change should,take place, but that it was expedient to leave the time, and the manner, of carrying it into effect to the discretion of the Lieutenant Governor and also, that the laws which were or might be in force in the other territo ries subject to the same Government were such as it might be fit and proper to apply to this 15 114 district also, but that, as it was not certain that all those laws, and every part of them, could with equal conven ience be so applied, it was expedient, on that point also, to entrust a discretion to the LieutenantGovernor.\\r\\nHis Lordship then proceeded to state the true meaning and effect of the provisions of section 9: \"This having been done as to the Garo Hills, what was done as to the Khasi and Jaintia Hills? The Legislature decided that it was fit and proper that the adjoining dis trict of the Khasi and Jaintia Hills should also be removed from the jurisdiction of the existing Courts, and brought under the same provisions with the Garo Hills, not neces sarily and at all events, but if and when the Lieutenant Governor should think it desirable to do so; and that it was also possible that it might be expedient that not all, but some only, of those provisions should be applied to that adjoining district.\\r\\nAnd accordingly the Legislature en trusted for these purposes also, a discretionary power to the Lieutenant Governor.\\r\\n\" Finally, his Lordship concluded at p. 195: \"Their Lordships think that it is a fallacy to speak of the powers thus conferred upon the LieutenantGovernor (large as they undoubtedly are) as if, when they were exercised, the efficacy of the acts done under them would be due to any other legislative authority than that of the Governor General in Council.\\r\\nTheir whole operation is, directly and immediately, under and by virtue of this Act XXII of 1869 itself.\\r\\nThe proper Legislature has exercised its judgment as to place, person, laws, powers; and the result of that judgment has been to legislate conditionally as to all these things.\\r\\nThe conditions having been fulfilled, the legisla tion is now absolute.\\r\\nWhere plenary powers of legislation exist as to particular subjects, whether in an imperial or in a provinciall Legislature, they may, in their Lordships \\' judgment be well exercised, either absolutely or condition ally.\\r\\nLegislation, conditional on the use of particular powers, or on the exercise of a limited discretion, entrust ed by the Legislature to persons in whom it places confi dence, 115 is no uncommon thing; and, in many circumstances, it may be highly convenient.\\r\\n\" If the reasonings underlying the observations of the \\' Bombay High Court were correct then on those very reasonings it could be held in Burah \\'s case(1) that while in enacting sections 1 to 8 the Legislature had applied its mind and laid down its policy as to the exclusion of the Garo Hills from the jurisdiction of the Courts the Legislature did not apply its mind and did not lay down any policy as to the exclusion of the Khasi and Jaintia Hills rom the jurisdic tion of the Courts but had left it to the Lieutenant Gover nor to do what it alone could do.\\r\\nThis construction quite clearly did not find favour with the Privy Council.\\r\\nThe Privy Council by construction spelt out of the very language section 9 that the Legislature itself had decided that it was fit and proper that the Khasi and Jaintia Hills should also be removed from the jurisdiction of the existing Courts and brought under the same provisions as applied to the Garo Hills, not necessarily and at all events but if and when the LieutenantGovernor should think it desirable to do so and accordingly entrusted a discretionary power to the Lieutenant Governor.\\r\\nAdopting the same method of construc tion and adopting the language of Lord Selborne it may well be said that in enacting section 3 the Legislature itself has determined, in the due and ordinary course of legisla tion, to establish an additional Court of civil jurisdiction with jurisdiction to entertain suits and other proceedings arising within the Greater Bombay of the value up to Rs. 10,000 leaving it, by section 1 (2), to the Provincial Government to say at what time that change should take place.\\r\\nLikewise, it may be said that in enacting section 4 the Legislature itself has decided that it is fit, and proper to extend the pecuniary jurisdiction of the new Court, not necessarily and at all events or all at once but if and when the Provincial Government should think it de sirable to do so and accordingly entrusted a discretionary power to the Provincial Government.\\r\\nIt is entirely wrong to say that the (1) L.R. 5 I.A. 178.\\r\\n116 Legislature has not applied its mind or laid down any poli cy.\\r\\nIndeed, the very fact that the extension of pecuniary jurisdiction should not exceed twenty five thousand rupees, that the extension should be subject to the exceptions specified in section 3 clearly indicate that the Legislature itself has decided that the extension of the pecuniary jurisdiction of the new Court should be made, not necessarily or at all events or all at any one time but when the Provincial Government may consider.\\r\\nit desirable to do so and while entrusting a discretionary power with the Provincial Government to determine the time for investing such extended jurisdiction on the new Court, the Legislature itself has also prescribed the limits of such extension.\\r\\nThe efficacy of the Act of extension of jurisdiction is, there fore, not due to any other legislative authority than that of the Legislature itself.\\r\\nThe expression \"invest\" does not appear to me to have any special significance.\\r\\nIt only implies or indicates the result of the fulfilment of the condition which the Legislature itself laid down.\\r\\nTo use the language of Lord Selborne the extension of jurisdiction is directly and immediately under and by virtue of this very Act itself.\\r\\nHere there is no effacement of the Legislature, no abdication of the legislative power.\\r\\nOn the contrary, the proper Legislature has exercised its judgment as to the possible necessity for the extension of the pecuniary juris diction of the new Court and the result of that judgment has been to legislate conditionally as to such extension and that the condition having been fulfilled by the issue of the notification by the Provincial Government the legislation has now become absolute.\\r\\nIn my judgment the construction put upon sections 3 and 4 by the High Court was erroneous and cannot be supported either on principle or on authority.\\r\\nWhen properly construed in the light of the observations and decision of the Privy CounCil in R.v. Burah(1) as indi cated above section 4 does not amount to a delegation of legislative power at all but constitutes what is known as conditional legislation.\\r\\n(1) L.R. 5 I.A 178.\\r\\n117 Reliance was placed by the High Court on the decision of the Federal Court of India in Jatindra Nath Gupta vs Prov ince of Bihar (1) in support of their conclusions.\\r\\nThat case was concerned with the question of the validity of the proviso to section 1 (3)of the Bihar Maintenance of Public Order Act (V of 1947).\\r\\nSection 1 (a) provided that the Act should remain in force for a period of one year from the date of its commencement.\\r\\nThe relevant part of the proviso was in the following terms: \"Provided that the Provincial Government may, by notifi cation, on a resolution passed by the Bihar Legislative Assembly and agreed to by the Bihar Legislative Council, direct that this Act shall remain in force for a further period of one year with such modifications, if any, as may be specified in the notification.\\r\\n\" Three of the learned Judges held that the proviso and the notification thereunder were ultra vires and void They laid particular emphasis on the power given to the Provin cial Government to make any modification in the Act when extending its life as indicating that it was a delegation of legislative power.\\r\\nAnother learned Judge did not decide this point but agreed to set aside the order of detention on another ground not material for our present purpose and the remaining learned Judge took a different view of the effect of the proviso and held that it was a conditional legisla tion within the meaning of the decision in R., vs Burah(2).\\r\\nI do not find it necessary, for the purposes of the present appeal, to express any view as to the correctness of the decision of the Federal Court in that case.\\r\\nAssuming, but without deciding, that the entrustment with the Provincial Government of the power to extend the life of an Act with such modifications as the Provincial Government in its unfettered discretion thought fit to make was nothing but a delegation of legislative powers, there is no such power of modification given to the Provincial Government by section 4 of the Bombay City Civil Court (1) A.I.R. 1949 F.C. 175, (.2) L.R. 5 I.A. 178.\\r\\nand, therefore, that decision of the Federal Court can have no application to the case before us.\\r\\nThe learned Attorney General wants to go further and contend that under the Government of India Act, 1935, it was permissible for the Legislatures, Central or Provincial, while acting within their respective legislative fields, to delegate their legislative powers.\\r\\nIn the view I have ex pressed above, namely, that section 4 of the Bombay City Civil Court Act, 1948, does not involve any delegation of legislative power, I do not consider it necessary, on this occasion, to go into that question and I reserve my right to consider and decide that question including the question of the correctness of the decision of the Federal Court in Jatindra Nath Gupta \\'s case(1) on that point as and when occasion may arise in future.\\r\\nLearned counsel for the first respondent then raises before us the larger question as to whether the Bombay City Civil Court Act, 1948, as a whole was or was not within the legislative competence of the Provincial Legislature of Bombay.\\r\\nLegislative powers were by section 100 of the Gov ernment of India Act, 1935, distributed amongst the Federal and the Provincial Legislatures.\\r\\nUnder that section the Federal Legislature had, and the Provincial Legislature had not, power to make laws with respect to any of the matters enumerated in List I in the Seventh Schedule to that Act.\\r\\nLikewise, the Provincial Legislature had, and the Federal Legislature had not, power to make laws the Province with respect to my of the matters enumerated in List II in that Schedule.\\r\\nIt will be noticed that \\'the section, while af firmatively giving legislative power with respect to certain matters to one Legislature, expressly excluded the legisla tive power of the other Legislature with respect to those matters.\\r\\nLastly, section 100 gave concurrent power of legis lation to the Federal as well as to the Provincial Legisla ture with respect to matters enumerated in List III in that Schedule.\\r\\nSection 107 of that Act made provision for resolv ing the inconsistency, if any, between a Provincial law and a Federal law or the existing Indian (1) A.I.R. 1949 F.C. 175 119 law with respect to any of the matters in the Concurrent List (i.e., List III).\\r\\nTurning now to the three lists we find several entries relating to Courts, the relevant por tions of which are as follows : List I. Entry 53: Jurisdiction and powers of all Courts, except the Federal Court, with respect to any of the matters in this list .\\r\\nList II.\\r\\nEntry 1: . . the administration of justice, constitution and organisation of all Courts, except the Federal Court, and fees taken therein; .\\r\\nEntry 2: Jurisdiction and powers of all Courts, except the Federal Court, with respect to any of the matters in this list; procedure in Rent and Revenue Courts.\\r\\nList III.\\r\\nPART 1.\\r\\nEntry 2: Criminal Procedure, including all matters included in the Code of the Criminal Procedure at the date of the passing of this Act.\\r\\nEntry 4: Civil Procedure, including the law of Limita tion and all matters included in the Code of Civil Procedure at the date of the passing of this Entry 15: Jurisdiction and powers of all Courts, except the Federal Court, with respect to any of the matters in this list.\\r\\nLearned Attorney General urges that entry 1 in List II clearly indicates that administration of justice had been expressly made a provincial subject and that it was only the Provincial Legislature which could make laws with respect to administration of justice.\\r\\nThe next steps in the argument are that there could be no administration of justice unless Courts were constituted and organised, that the constitution and organisation of Courts would be meaningless enterprises for the Provincial Legislatures to indulge in, unless the Courts so constituted and organised were 120 vitalised by being invested with jurisdiction and powers to receive, try and determine suits and other proceedings.\\r\\nThe argument, therefore, is that entry 1 in List II by itself gave power to the Provincial Legislature not only to consti tute and organise Courts but also to confer jurisdiction and powers on them.\\r\\nThe learned Attorney General relies on Jagtiani \\'s case(1) and points out that under entry 1 admin istration of justice was entirely a provincial responsibili ty and the Provincial Legislature was authorised to make laws with respect to administration of justice.\\r\\nAdministra tion of justice, so the argument \\' proceeds, is inseparable from Courts and Courts without jurisdiction is an incompre hensible notion.\\r\\nThe conclusion sought to be established.\\r\\ntherefore, is that under entry 1 alone of List II the Provincial Legislature had power to make a law not merely constituting a new Court but, investing such new Court with general jurisdiction and powers to receive, try and deter mine all suits and other proceedings.\\r\\nIf entry 1 in List II stood alone and entry 53 in List I, entry 2 in List II and entry 15 in List HI were not in the Seventh Schedule, the argument would have been unanswerable.\\r\\nIn Section 92 of the British North America Act, 1867, there was no separate provision authorising the making of laws with respect to jurisdiction and powers of Courts and, therefore, the au thority to make laws with respect to the jurisdiction and powers of Courts had of necessity to be found in and spelt out of the words \\' \\'administration of justice\" occurring in section 92 (14) of that Act.\\r\\nThere is, however, no such pressing or compelling necessity for giving such wide and all embracing meaning to the words \"administration of jus tice\" in entry 1 of List 11.\\r\\nThe expression \"administration of justice\" may be an expression of wide import and may ordinarily, and in the absence of anything indicating any contrary intention, cover and include within its ambit several things as component parts of it, namely, the consti tution and organisation of Courts, jurisdiction and powers of the Courts and the laws to be administered by the Courts.\\r\\nBut the legislative (1) 51 Bom.\\r\\nL.B. 86.\\r\\n121 practice in England as well as in India has been to deal With these topics separately in legislative enactments: see for example Indian High Courts Act 1861.\\r\\n(24 and 25 Vic., c. 104) sections 2 and 19; Government of India Act, 1935, sections 220 and 223, the Letters i Patent of the Bombay High Court, 1865, and also the different Civil Courts Acts.\\r\\nOf these, one topic, namely, \"constitution and organisa tion of Courts\" had been expressly included in entry 1 of List II in addition to \"administration of justice\", a fact of some significance which must be noted although I do not say that the inclusion of the words \"constitution and organ isation of all Courts\" in entry 1 of List II by itself and in the absence of anything else cut down the generality of the meaning of the expression \"administration of justice\" which preceded those words, for such a construction may militate against the principle laid down by the Privy Coun cil in Meghraj vs Allah Rakhia(1).\\r\\nFurther, entry 2 in List II would have been wholly unnecessary if the expression \"administration of justice\" in entry 1 in List II were to be given the wide meaning contended for by the learned Attor neyGeneral, for if under entry 1 \\' in List II the Provincial Legislature had plenary powers to make laws conferring on, or taking away from, Courts, existing or newly constituted, 0jurisdiction and powers of the widest description, such power would also include the lesser power of conferring jurisdiction and powers with respect to any of the matters enumerated in List II, such as is contemplated by entry 2 in List II.\\r\\nThe greater power would certainly have included the lesser.\\r\\nI do not say that the presence of entry 2 in List II by itself cut down the ambit of the expression \"administration of justice\" in entry 1, for if there were only entries 1 and 2 in List II and there were no entries like entry 53 in List I and entry 15 in List III, it might have been argued with some plausibility that in framing the two entries in the same list not much care was bestowed by the draftsman to prevent overlapping and that as (1) L.R. 74 I.A. 12, at p.20 16 16 122 both the entries in one and the same list gave legislative power to the same Legislature the overlapping caused no confusion or inconvenience and that it was not necessary, therefore, to construe entry 1 of List II as cut down by entry 2 in the same List.\\r\\nThe important thing to notice is that the topic of \"jUrisdiction and powers of Courts\" had not been included in entry 1 in List II along with the topic of \"constitUtion and organization of Courts\", but the legislative powers with respect to the topic of \"jurisdic tion and powers of the Courts\" had been distributed between the Federal and the Provincial Legislatures in the manner set forth in entry 53 in List I, entry 2 in List II and entry 15 in List III.\\r\\nThe inclusion of \"constitution and organisation of Courts\" as a separate item in entry 1 in List II, the omission of the topic of \"jurisdiction and powers of Courts\" from entry 1 and the deliberate distribu tion of powers to make laws with respect to jurisdiction and powers of Courts with respect to the several matters speci fied in the three lists clearly indicate to my mind that the intention of Parliament was not, by entry 1 in List II by itself, to authorise the Provincial Legislature to make any law with respect to the jurisdiction and powers of Courts.\\r\\nIn my judgment, entry 1 in List II cannot be read as at all giving any power to the Provincial Legislature to confer any jurisdiction or power on any Court it might constitute or organise under that entry and that the expressions \"admin istration of justice\" and \"constitution and organisation of Courts\" occurring in entry 1 in List II should be read as exclusive of \"the jurisdiction and powers of Courts\" the powers of legislation with respect to which were distributed under entry 53 in List I, entry 2 in List II and entry 15 in List III.\\r\\nSuch a construction will be consonant with the principle of construction laid down by, the Privy Council in the case of In re Marriage Legislation in Canada(1).\\r\\nIt is next said that entry 1 in List II gave general powers to the Provincial Legislature to make laws (1) 123 conferring general jurisdiction and powers on Courts consti tuted by it under that entry while entry 53 in List I, entry 2 in List II and entry 15 in List III conferred special powers on the Federal and Provincial Legislatures to make laws conferring special jurisdiction and powers with respect to matters specified in their respective Lists.\\r\\nAs I have already pointed out, if entry 1 in List II conferred plenary powers on the Provincial Legislature to make laws with respect to jurisdiction and powers of Courts in widest terms, entry 2 in List II would be wholly redundant, for the wider power itself would include the lesser power.\\r\\nFurther,the very concession that entry 53 in List 1, entry 2 in List II and entry 15 in List III gave special powers to the Legislature to confer special jurisdiction and powers necessarily amounts to an admission that the powers conferred on the Provincial Legislature by entry 1 in List II were exclusive of the powers conferred under entry 53 in List I, entry 2 in List II and entry 15 in List III, for if entry 1 in List II gave power to the Provincial Legislature to make laws conferring general jurisdiction of the widest kind which included jurisdiction and powers with respect to all matters specified in all the Lists, then the utility of entry 53 in List I, entry 2 in List II and entry 15 in List III as giving special powers to make laws conferring special jurisdiction would vanish altogether.\\r\\nSpecial power to confer special jurisdiction would be meaningless if it were included in the general power also.\\r\\nThis circumstance by itself should be sufficient to induce the Court to assign a limited scope and ambit to the power conferred on the Pro vincial Legislature under entry 1 in List II.\\r\\nWe, there fore, come back to the same conclusion that entry 1 in List II should be construed and read as conferring on the Provin cial Legislature all powers with respect to administration of justice and constitution and organisation of Courts minus the power to make laws with respect to the jurisdiction and powers of Courts.\\r\\nIt is pointed out that under entry 1 in List II it was only the Provincial Legislature which alone could 124 constitute and organise a new Court and if that entry did not empower the Provincial Legislature to vest in such new Court the general jurisdiction and power to re ceive, try and dispose of all kinds of suits and other proceedings, then no new Court of general jurisdiction could be established at all.\\r\\nAs will be seen hereafter, the Provincial Legislature has, under entry 2 in List II, power to make laws conferring wide general jurisdiction and powers on a newly constituted Court and consequently a forced construction need not be placed on entry 1 in List II.\\r\\nIt is said that if the Provincial Legislature could not, under entry 1 in List II, confer jurisdiction on a new Court set up by under that entry, the result would have been that the Provincial Legislature would have had to set up a new Court by one law made under entry 1 of List II without conferring on it any jurisdiction whatever and would have had to make another law with respect to \\' the jurisdic tion and powers of such Court.\\r\\nI see no force in this, for the Provincial Legislature could by one and the same law have set up a Court under entry 1 in List II and vested in the Court jurisdiction and powers with respect to any of the matters specified in List II and, subject to section 107 of the Act, with respect to any of the matters enumerated in List III.\\r\\nIt is wrong to assume that the Provincial Legisla ture could not make one law under both entry 1 and entry 2 in List II and entry 15 in List III at one and the same time.\\r\\nA good deal of argument was advanced before us as to the applicability of the doctrine of pith and substance and, indeed, the decision of the Bombay High Court in Jagtiani \\'s case was practically rounded on that doctrine.\\r\\nShortly put, the argument, as advanced, is that under entry 1 in List II the Provincial Legislature had power to make laws with respect to administration of justice; that, therefore, the Provincial Legislature had power, under entry 1 itself, to make laws conferring general jurisdiction and powers on Courts constituted and organised by it under that entry; that if in making such law 125 the Provincial Legislature incidentally enroached upon the legislative field assigned to the Federal Legislature under entry 58 in List I with respect to the jurisdiction and powers of Court with respect to any of the matters specified in List I, such incidental encrochment did not invalidate the law, as in pith and substance it was a law within the legislative powers.\\r\\nIn my judgment, this argu ment really begs the question.\\r\\nThe doctrine of pith and substance postulates, for its application, that the impugned law is substantially within the legislative competence of the particular Legislature that made it, but only inciden tally encroached upon the legislative field of another Legislature.\\r\\nThe doctrine saves this incidental en croachment if only the law is in pith and substance within the legislative field of the particular Legislature which made it.\\r\\nTherefore, if the Provincial Legislature under entry 1 had power to vest general jurisdiction on a newly constituted Court, then if the law made by it incidentally gave jurisdiction to the Court with respect to matters specified in List I the question of the applicability of the doctrine of pith and substance might have arisen.\\r\\nI have already pointed out that, on a proper construction, entry 1 of List II did not empower the Provincial Legislature to confer any jurisdiction or power on the Court and the ex pression \"administration of justice\" had to be read as covering matters relating to administration of justice other than jurisdiction and powers of Court and, if that were so, the discussion of the doctrine of pith and substance does not arise at all.\\r\\nI find it difficult to support the rea sonings adopted by the Bombay High Court in Jagtiani \\'s case.\\r\\nThe argument as to the applicability of the doctrine of pith and substance to the impugned Act can, however, be well maintained in the following modified form: Under entry 2 in List II the Provincial Legislature had power to make laws with respect to the jurisdiction and powers of Courts with respect to any of the matters enumerated in List II; that \"administration of justice\" in entry 1 is one of the matters in 126 List II; that, therefore, the Provincial Legislature had power to confer the widest general jurisdiction on any new Court or take away the entire jurisdiction from any existing Court and there being this power, the doctrine of pith and substance applies.\\r\\nIt is suggested that this argument cannot be formulated in view of the language used in entry 2 in List II.\\r\\nIt is pointed out that entry 2 treats \"any of the matters in this List\" as subject matter \"with respect to\" which, i.e., \"over\" which the Court may be authorised to exercise jurisdiction and power.\\r\\nThis construction of entry 2 is obviously fallacious, because jurisdiction and powers of the Court \"over\" administration of justice as a subject matter is meaningless and entry 2 can never be read with entry 1.\\r\\nThis circumstance alone shows that the words \\' \\'with respect to\" occurring in entry 2 in List 11 when applied to entry 1 did not mean \"over\" but really meant \"relating to\" or \"touching\" or \"concerning\" or \"for\" admin istration of justice, and so read and understood, entry 2, read with entry 1 in List 11, clearly authorised the Provin cial Legislature to make a law conferring on or taking away from a Court general jurisdiction and powers relating to or touching or concerning or for administration of justice.\\r\\nThis line of reasoning has been so very fully and lucidly dealt with by my brother Sastri J. that I have nothing to add thereto and I respectfully adopt his reasonings and conclusion on the point.\\r\\nThis argument, in my opinion, resolves all difficulties by vesting power in the Provincial Legislature to confer general jurisdiction on Courts consti tuted and organised by it for effective administration of justice which was made its special responsibility.\\r\\nAny argument as to deliberate encroachment that might have been rounded on the Proviso to section 3 of the Act which ena bled the Provincial Government to give to the City Court even Admiralty jurisdiction which was a matter in List I has been set at rest by the amendment of the Proviso by Bombay Act XXVI of 1950.\\r\\nThe impugned Bombay Act may, in my judg ment, be well supported as a law made by the Provincial Legislature under 127 entry 2 read with entry 1 in List II and I hold accordingly.\\r\\nI, therefore, concur in the order that this appeal be al lowed.\\r\\nIn the view I have taken, it is not necessary to discuss the contention of the learned Attorney General that the Bombay City Civil Court Act may be supported as a piece of legislation made by the Provincial Legislature of Bombay under entry 4 read with entry 15 in Part I of List III and I express no opinion on that point.\\r\\nAppeal allowed.\\r\\n', {'entities': [[0, 15,

Kohli, with him) for the Cavea tor. 1951.\\r\\nDecember 19.\\r\\nThe Judgment of the Court was deliv ered by FAZL ALl J.\\r\\nThis is an appeal against the judgment of the High Court at Patiala upholding the conviction and sentence of the appellant, who was tried by the Sessions Judge of Sangrut for the offence of murder and sentenced to death.\\r\\n373 The prosecution story is a somewhat long and complicated one, but ignoring unnecessary details, the material facts may be shortly stated as follows : On the 5th October, 1949, there was a quarrel between the appellant and one Darbara Singh, in the course of which the appellant attacked the latter with a phawra (a cutting instrument).\\r\\nAbout that time, Gurmail Singh, the deceased person, returned to his house, which was close to the house of Darbara Singh, from his cotton field, where he had been working, in order to take tea for his companions who were still working in his field.\\r\\nThe appellant asked Gutmail Singh to lend him a spear to enable him to kill Darbara Singh, but since the latter refused to do so, there ensued a quarrel between him and the appellant, in the course of which they exchanged abuses and grappled with each other, and the fight was stopped only by the intervention of cer tain persons present at the place.\\r\\nIt appears that the appellant was greatly affected by this quarrel, and thereaf ter he is said to have armed himself with a rifle and at tacked 3 persons in the vicinity of Gurmail Singh \\'s cotton field.\\r\\nHe fired firstly at Kartar Singh, son of Satwan Singh, while the latter was returning to his house from the field of Gutmail Singh, but he was not hurt.\\r\\nSoon after that, while Gurmail Singh was returning to his field after attending to his buffaloes in a garden which was nearby, the appellant chased him and fired at him thereby causing his instantaneous death.\\r\\nLastly, he is said to have fired at Kartar Singh, son of Bishan Singh and one Jangir Singh, while they were raising an alarm, but the bullet missed them.\\r\\nUpon these allegations, the following three charges were framed against him : \"(1) That you. fired a shot at Gurmail Singh deceased with rifle P.I. with the intention of killing him and caused his death and thereby committed an offence pun ishable under section 302. (2) That you. fired a shot at Kartar Singh and Jangir Singh with rifle P.I. with the intention of causing death and made an attempt to cause their death 374 section 307. . (3) That you. . fired a gun shot at Kartar Singh s/o Satwan Singh. with the intention of killing him and made an attempt to cause his death and thereby committed an offence punishable under section 307. \" It appears that the appellant was an Instructor in the Home Guards.\\r\\nand the rifle which he is said to have used had been given to him by his superior officer with 20 rounds of ammunition.\\r\\nTo support their version of the occurrence, the prosecu tion examined 3 eye witnesses whose evidence has been ac cepted by both the courts below after careful scrutiny.\\r\\nThe learned Sessions Judge acquitted the appellant of the second and third charges under section 307 of the Indian Penal Code, holding that there was no convincing evidence that the appellant intended to murder Jangit Singh and the other 2 persons.\\r\\nHe however convicted him of the first charge under section 302 of the Indian Penal Code and sentenced him to death, which sentence was later confirmed by the High Court.\\r\\nThe learned counsel for the appellant had very little to argue on the merits of the case, but he seriously contended that there had been a misjoinder of charges which could not be tried together under the law, and the illegality so committed had vitiated the whole trial of the appellant.\\r\\nIt appears that in the High Court, the line of argument on this point was somewhat different from the line adopted in this court.\\r\\nWhat was stressed in that court seems to have been that the three incidents in respect of which the appellant was charged not having happened in the course of the same transaction, they could not have been properly made the subject of one trial, and for this contention reliance was placed mainly on section 235 (1)of the Criminal Procedure Code, which provides that \"if, in one series of acts so connected together as to form the same transaction, more offences than one are committed by the same person, he may be at one trial for, every such offence.\\r\\n\" It should be noted 375 that that section is only one of the exceptions to the general rule laid down in section 233 of the Code that for every distinct offence, there shall be a separate charge and every such charge shall be tried separately.\\r\\nIn this court, no reference was made to section 235, but the argument was confined to the question as to whether the present case falls within another exception of section 23 \\'3 which is contained in section 234 (1) which runs as \\'follows : \"When a person is accused of more offences than one of the same kind committed within the space of twelve months from the first to the last of such offences, whether in respect of the same person or not, he may be charged with, and tried at one trial for any number of them not exceeding three.\\r\\n\" It was argued before us that even though only 3 charges have been framed against the appellant, he has in fact been tried for 4 offences and not 3.\\r\\nThe 4 offences are said to be these : (1) Committing the murder of Gurmail Singh; (2) Attempting to murder Kartar Singh, son of Sarwan Singh; (3) Attempting to murder Jangit Singh; and (4) Attempting to murder Kartar Singh, son of Bishan Singh.\\r\\nThe learned counsel contended that the fact that the appellant has been acquitted of the last 3 offences and convicted only of the first offence was immaterial to the point raised by him, and we have only to see whether all the offences mentioned above could be properly tried together.\\r\\nIn our opinion, the short reply to this contention is that the second charge which relates to the appellant firing at Kartar Singh and Jangir Singh is not a charge with respect to 2 offences but is a charge with respect to one offence only.\\r\\nThe evidence adduced by the prosecution shows that the appellant fired only one bullet.\\r\\nThe word \"offence\" has been defined in the Criminal Procedure Code as meaning \"any act or omission made punishable by any law for the time being in force\".\\r\\nThere seems to be 49 376 nothing wrong in law to regard the single act of firing by the appellant as one offence only.\\r\\nOn the other hand, we think that it would be taking an extremely narrow and arti ficial view to split it into 2 offences.\\r\\nThere are several reported cases in which a similar view has been taken, and in our opinion they have not been incorrectly decided.\\r\\nIn Queen Empress vs Raghu Rai(1), where a person stole several bullocks from the same herdsman at the same time, it was held that only one offence had been committed.\\r\\nIn Promotha Nath Ray vs King Emperor(2), it was held that misappropria tion in regard to several account books constituted only one offence.\\r\\nIn Johan Subarna vs King EmPeror(3), it was held that when an attempt to cheat a number of men by speaking to them in a body had been committed, one joint charge was valid.\\r\\nIn Poonit Singh vs Madho Bhot (4), it was held that only one offence had been committed by a person who gave false information in one statement to the police against 2 persons.\\r\\nIn Sudheendrakumar Ray vs Emperor(5), a person who was chased by 2 constables had fired at them several times, but it seems to have been rightly assumed that the firing did not constitute more than one offence, though the point was not specifically raised or decided.\\r\\nIn our opinion, there is no substance in the point raised, though we should not be understood as laying down the wide proposition that in no case can a single act constitute more than one of fence.\\r\\nThe other points urged on behalf of the appellant before us were somewhat unsubstantial points relating to the merits of the case, which it is not usual for this court to allow to be raised in appeals by special leave.\\r\\nIn our opinion, this appeal is without merit, and it is accordingly dismissed.\\r\\nAppeal dismissed.\\r\\nAgent for the caveator: Vidya Sagar.\\r\\n', {'entities': [[3, 34, 'CASE_NUMBER'], [78, 99, 'COURT'], [101, 137, 'JUDGE'], [145, 162, 'DATE'], [167, 197, 'CASE_NUMBER'], [279, 287, 'GPE'], [289, 317, 'LAWYER'], [339, 353, 'LAWYER'], [392, 416, 'RESPONDENT'], [418, 428, 'LAWYER'], [462, 477, 'LAWYER'], [479, 490, 'LAWYER'], [521, 540, 'DATE'], [586, 597, 'JUDGE'], [659, 666, 'GPE'], [762, 769, 'GPE'], [982, 999, 'DATE'], [1179, 1192, 'WITNESS'], [1270, 1283, 'WITNESS'], [1489, 1502, 'WITNESS'], [1939, 1952, 'WITNESS'], [1991, 2024, 'WITNESS'], [2372, 2384, 'WITNESS'], [2414, 2426, 'WITNESS'], [2600, 2613, 'WITNESS'], [2739, 2761, 'PROVISION'], [2788, 2800, 'WITNESS'], [2915, 2927, 'PROVISION'], [3120, 3132, 'PROVISION'], [3584, 3620, 'PROVISION'], [3796, 3832, 'PROVISION'], [4637, 4682, 'PROVISION'], [4998, 5009, 'PROVISION'], [5338, 5353, 'PROVISION']]}]\n",

Fazl Ali J. delivered a separate judgment.\\r\\nMAHAJAN J.\\r\\nThe question involved in the appeal relates to the right of succession to six Birbhum ghatwalis governed by Regulation XXIX of 1814, annexed to Gaddi Pathrol and lying within Tappasarath in the Santhal Parganas.\\r\\nthe genealogy of the contestants appears from the following pedigree table: .\\r\\nDigbijoy Singh I Gurohari SinghKanhai Singh Bhairo Singh Balram Singh (Ghatwal) I I Pratar Singh I I I I I Banwari Singh Pitambar Katku Singh Bharat Singh (Died (Ghatwal) issueless) I Kharagdhari Singh (Ghatwal) I Ram Chandra Singh (Ghatwal) I I Brijbehari Singh Sarju Prasad Singh (Ghatwal) (Original plaintiff) I I Krishna Prasad Singh Hargobind Prasad Singh (Ghatwal) (Substituted plaintiff) I I Kali Prasad Singh Durga Prasad (Ghatwal) ( Died issueless) I Phaldani Kumari (Defendant) Tikait Kali Prasad Singh, the last gaddidar of Pathrol, died in the year 1935.\\r\\nHe belonged to the Baisi Chaurasi clan.\\r\\nOn the 29th November, 1935, the 155 Commissioner of Bhagalpur Division recognized Smt.\\r\\nPhaldani Kumari as the next ghatwal and entitled to be maintained in possession of the ghatwali estate on the 30th November, 1936, sarju Prasad Singh brought the suit out of which this appeal arises in forma pauperis in the court of the Subor dinate Judge of Deoghar for possession of the ghatwalis.\\r\\nIn paragraphs 7, 8 and 10 of the plaint it was alleged that the ghatwalis in suit were joint family property and were im partible by custom; that succession to them was governed by the law of lineal primogeniture; that the females and persons claiming through them were altogether excluded from inheritance.\\r\\nIt was claimed that the late Tikait Kali Prasad Singh and the plaintiff were members of a joint Mitakshara family and that he alone as the eldest member of the eldest surviving line of the descendants of the common ancestor was entitled to succeed to them.\\r\\nThe defendant in her written statement denied this claim and contended that Birbhum ghatwalis governed by Regulation XXIX of 1814 are not and cannot be in the nature of joint family property but that the person who succeeds and holds the tenure as ghatwal is the sole proprietor and owner thereof.\\r\\nIt was pleaded that the properties being the exclusive and separate properties of the ghatwal for the time being, the defendant, his widow, was entitled to suc ceed to them in preference to the plaintiff under the Mitak shara school of Hindu law which admittedly governed the family of the parties.\\r\\nThe pleadings of the parties gave rise to the following issues : 1.\\r\\nWhether succession to the ghatwalis in question is governed by the customs alleged in para 7 of the plaint ? 2.\\r\\nDid the ghatwalis in question form joint family property of Kali Prasad Singh, his ancestors in the direct line and of Sarju Prasad Singh and the plaintiff? 3.\\r\\nDid Kali Prasad die in a state of jointness with Sarju Prasad Singh ? 156 4.\\r\\nAre the ghatwals the sole proprietors of the ghatwalis for the time being as alleged by the defendant ? 5.\\r\\nWhether the plaintiff or the defendant is entitled to succeed to the properties in suit ? Issues 2, 3 and 4 were found by the trial Judge in favour of the plaintiff and against the defendant.\\r\\nIt was held that Kali Prasad Singh died in a state of jointness with Sarju Prasad Singh and that the ghatwalis in question were their joint family property and that the plaintiff the eldest surviving copartner in the eldest line of Digbijoy Singh \\'s descendants was entitled to succeed to them in preference to the widow.\\r\\nIt was common ground between the parties that in case the properties were held to be the separate properties of Kali Prasad Singh, the widow was entitled to succeed to them.\\r\\nAs a result of these findings the plaintiff \\'s suit was decreed with costs.\\r\\nOn appeal by the widow to the High Court, this.\\r\\ndecree was reversed and the plaintiff \\'s suit was dismissed with costs.\\r\\nIt was held that the character of the ghatwali tenures in question was such that they could not be regarded as joint property of the plaintiff and the last ghatwal and that being so, the defendant was entitled to succeed to them.\\r\\nThe learned counsel for the appellant based his argu ments on the thesis that the ghatwali estates in question were of the same nature and character as joint family im partible estates governed by the Mitakshara law and that the rule of survive applicable to such estates was also applicable to them.\\r\\nIt was contended that the High Court was in error in holding that the suit properties exclusively belonged to Kali Prasad Singh or that there was anything peculiar in these tenures which differentiated them from other ghatwalis in the Santhai Pargangs or from other im partible estates known to Hindu law and which peculiarity incapacitated them from being included within the definition of coparcenary property.\\r\\nThe plea that females were by custom excluded from inheriting ghatwali tenures in Birbhum was 157 dropped in the two courts below and was \\' not raised before us; so also the point of custom set out in para.\\r\\n7 of the plaint and covered by issue 1 was not seriously urged.\\r\\nThe learned Attorney General, while conceding that succession to these tenures was governed by the Mitakshara law, contended that in no sense could they be regarded as joint family property and that their peculiar characteris tics precluded the acquisition of any right by birth by members of a joint Hindu family in them.\\r\\nHe also urged in the alternative that the widow was \\'entitled to succeed to them, assuming them to be joint family property under cus tom.\\r\\nThe courts below have given elaborate judgments in the case and reference has been made to a large number of decid ed cases.\\r\\nIn our opinion, the main point that needs decision is whether the suit ghatwalis were to be regarded as joint family or separate properties of the deceased.\\r\\nFor a solu tion of this problem it is necessary to refer first to the nature and main incidents of a ghatwali tenure.\\r\\nIts origin is now well known.\\r\\nIn Moghul times grants of land were made to selected persons who were appointed guardians of the mountain passes for protecting the countryside against hill invaders and the office held by these persons bore the designation \"ghatwal\".\\r\\nThese grants were made in some cases directly by the ruling power and in other cases by the zamindar responsible by custom for the maintenance of secu rity and order within the estate as consideration for the performance of the duties.\\r\\nBy efflux of time these grants assumed the form of an actual estate in land, heritable and perpetual, but conditional upon services certain or services to be demanded.\\r\\nReference to some of the decided cases relating to Birbhum ghatwali tenures will sufficiently indicate their nature and character.\\r\\nIn Harlal Singh vs Joravan Singh(1), it was held that a ghatwali estate in Birbhum was not divisible (1) 6 Select.\\r\\nRep.204.\\r\\n21 158 on the death of a ghatwal, amongst his heirs but should devolve entirely on the eldest son or the next ghatwal.\\r\\nIt was said that ghatwali lands are grants for particular pur poses, especially of police, and to divide them into small portions amongst the heirs of the ghatwals would defeat the very ends for which the grants were made.\\r\\nIn Satrukchunder Dey vs Bhagat Bharutchunder Singh(1), a decision of the year 1853, it was stated that the ghatwali tenures in Birbhum were not private property of the ghatwals but lands assigned by the State in remuneration for specific police services and were not alienable or attachable for personal debts.\\r\\nKustooree Koomaree vs Monohur Deo(2), Loch J. took the view that succession to ghatwalis is regulated by no rule of kulachar or family custom, nor by the Mitakshara law, but solely by the nature of the ghatwali tenure, which descends undivided to the party who succeeds to and holds the tenure as ghatwal and that a female is not incapable of holding a ghatwali tenure.\\r\\nIt was said that \"the party who succeeds to and holds the tenure as ghatwal must be, and has always been, looked upon as sole proprietor thereof, and, therefore, the other members of the family cannot claim to be coparceners and entitled to share in the profits of the property, though they may, by the permission and goodwill of the incumbent, derive their support, either from some portion of the property which he may have assigned to them, or directly from himself.\" In Binode Ram Sein vs Deputy Commissioner of Santhai Pargangs(3), (on review it was held that the rents of a ghatwali tenure are not liable for the debts of the former deceased holder of the tenure.\\r\\nThe reason for the decision was that the tenure was held for the purpose of public services and those who perform the services are entitled to the whole of the remuneration.\\r\\n(1) 9 S.D.R. 900.\\r\\n(3) (2) 1864 W.R. (Gap Nos.) 39.\\r\\n159 In Tekait Durga Pershad Singh vs Teketnee Durga Kuari(1), it was urged that a female \\'s right to inherit was inconsistent with a ghatwali estate.\\r\\nThis contention was negatived and reference was made to the fact that many ghatwali estates were held by females and it was observed that it was difficult to hold that a ghatwali estate must necessarily be held by male heirs.\\r\\nThis case further sug gests that in a case where it is held proved that the family was joint, succession to Birbhum ghatwali may be regulated by the same rule of Hindu law as is applicable to the devo lution of impartible estates.\\r\\nIn Ram Narain Singh vs Ramoon Paurey(2), another Birbhum ghatwali case, it was held that the ghatwal for the time being was only entitled to interest on the compensation money obtained for compulsory acquisition of a part of the ghatwali interest but that he could not spend the corpus of it which had to devolve on the next heir intact.\\r\\nSo far as Birbhum ghatwalis are concerned, it is only the above mentioned cases to which our attention was drawn.\\r\\nReference in this connection is also necessary to the terms of Regulation XXIX of 1814.\\r\\nSections I and II of the Regulation which are material to this enquiry are in these terms : I.\\r\\nWhereas the lands held by the class of persons denom inated Ghautwauls, in the district of Beerbhoom, form a peculiar tenure to which the provisions of the existing Regulations are not expressly applicable; and whereas every ground exists to believe that, according to the former usages and constitution of the country, this class of per sons are entitled to hold their lands, generation after generation, in perpetuity, subject nevertheless to the payment of a fixed and established rent to the zemindar of Beerbhoom, and to the performance of certain duties for the maintenance of the public peace and support of the police; and whereas the rents payable by those tenants have been (1) (2) 160 recently adjusted, after a full and minute inquiry made by the proper officers in the revenue department; and whereas it is essential to give stability to the arrangements now established among the Ghautwauls, the following rules have been adopted, to be in force from the period of their pro mulgation in the district of Beerbhoom.\\r\\nA settlement having lately been made on the part of the Government with the Ghautwauls in the district of Beerb hoom, it is hereby declared that they and their descendants in perpetuity shall be maintained in possession of the lands, so long as they shall respectively pay the revenue at present assessed upon them,. \" The result of the decided cases and of the provisions of the regulation is that the grantee of the tenure and his descendants have to be maintained in possession of the land from generation to generation conditional upon services to be rendered.\\r\\nThe tenure is however liable to forfeiture for misconduct or misbehavior of the ghatwal for the time being.\\r\\nThe succession to it is determined by the rule of lineal primogeniture.\\r\\nIt is neither partible nor alienable (except in exceptional cases with the consent of the government or the zamindar, as the case may be).\\r\\nThese two characteristics are inherent in its very nature and have not been annexed to it by any rule of custom.\\r\\nThe estate in the hands of the last holder is not liable either to attachment or sale in execution of a decree against him; nor is it liable in the hands of his successor for payment of his debts.\\r\\nWhen the succession opens out, the heir determined according to law has to execute a muchilika in favour of the grantor guaranteeing the performance of the duties annexed to the office and stipulating that in case of misconduct or misbehaviour or non fulfilment of the obligations attaching to the office, as to which the tenure is in the nature of a remuneration, government will have the right to resume it.\\r\\nIn view of these peculiar characteristics of a ghatwali tenure in Birbhum which are so different from other inheri tances, we find it difficult to apply to it the 161 law of Mitakshara to the full extent.\\r\\nThe essence of a coparcenary under the Mitakshara law is unity of ownership.\\r\\nAs observed in Katama Natchir vs The Raja of Sivaganga(1), there has to be community of interest and unity of posses sion between all the, members of the family, and upon the death of any one of them the others may well take by survi vorship that in which they had during the deceased \\'s life time a common interest and a common possession.\\r\\nThe inci dents attaching to a Birbhum ghatwali tenure rule out the existence of any notion of community of interest and unity of possession of the members of the family with the holder for the time being.\\r\\nHe is entitled to be maintained in exclusive possession of the ghatwali lands and the devolu tion of the property is to him in the status of a sole heir.\\r\\nThis view finds support from the observations of Lord Fitz gerald in Kali Pershad vs Anand Roy(2), though made in respect of a zamindari ghatwali, yet also appositely ap plicable to a government ghatwali.\\r\\nHis Lordship observed as follows : \"Where, however, the Mitakshara governs, each son imme diately on his birth takes a share equal to his father in the ancestral immoveable estate.\\r\\nHaving regard to the origin and nature of ghatwali tenures and their purposes and inci dents as established by decided cases, most of which have been referred to in the course of the argument, it is admit ted that such a tenure is in some particulars distinct from, and cannot be governed by, either the general objects of Hindu inheritance as above stated, or by the before quoted rule of the Mitakshara.\\r\\nIt is admitted that a ghatwali estate is impartable that is to say, not subject to partition; that the eldest son succeeds to the whole to the exclusion of his brothers.\\r\\nThese are propositions that seem to exclude the application of the Mitakshara rule that the sons on birth each take an equal estate with the father and are entitled to partition.\\r\\n\" Similar opinion was expressed in Chhalraclhari Singh vs Saraswati Kumari(3), by a Bench of the (1) (1861 3) 9 M.I.A. 543.\\r\\n(3) Cal.\\r\\n(2) Cal.\\r\\n471. 162 Calcutta High Court.\\r\\nThe following passage from that a decision may be quoted with advantage : \"The learned pleader for the appellant has however con tended before us ,that, although this ghatwali tenure is impartible, yet according to the decision of their Lordships of the Privy Council in Chintaman Singh vs Nowlukho Koon wari(1), it is not necessarily separate property, and that as their Lordships observe \\'whether the general status of a Hindu family be joint or undivided, property which is joint will follow one and property which is separate will follow another course of succession. \\' The decision referred to is no doubt an authority for the proposition that there may be impartible joint family property, such as a raj or other estate similar to a raj, but whether such property is to be regarded as joint or separate would appear to depend generally upon the character of the property at its incep tion, such as the nature of the grant, etc.\\r\\ncreating it.\\r\\nHaving regard however to the view we have already expressed as to the status of the family in the present case, and as to the ghatwali tenure having been the exclusive property of Ananta Narain, we think it is unnecessary to determine what was originally the character of this tenure, although, if we were called upon to decide the question, we should be disposed to say, with reference to the peculiar character of these tenures as described in Regulation XXIX of 1814, that they were intended to be the exclusive property of the ghatwalforthe time being, and not joint family property in the proper sense of the In Raja Durga Prashad Singh vs Tribeni Singh(2), again it was said as follows : \"It was certainly an advantage to the whole family that one of their members should hold the office and the tenure.\\r\\nHe could put other members of the family into minor offices and grant them subordinate interests commonly called jotes, and he could and would generally provide for the family in the manner (1) (2) (1918) 45 I.A. 251. 163 expected of its head.\\r\\nBut this is a long way off making him a trustee for the family or treating the ghatwali estate as possessed by the family and reducing the ghatwali to the position of karta or managing head of the family.\\r\\nTheir Lordships do not find that the incidents of ghatwali tenure are such as to give the family any rights over the property while it is in the hands of the ghatwal, and they find themselves upon this point in full agreement with the courts in India.\\r\\n\" In Narayan Singh vs Niranjan Chakravarti(1), Lord Sumner made an exhaustive review of the decided cases and examined the whole position of ghatwali tenures generally and ob served that where the tenure is hereditary, a recognized right to be appointed ghatwal takes the place of a formal appointment and a recognized right in the superior to dis miss the ghatwal if he is no longer able and willing to render the service required by his tenure, and to appoint another to the office and the tenure of the lands, then readily suffices to maintain in perpetuity the incidents of the tenure.\\r\\nIn these circumstances it is not possible to hold that the Mitakshara rule that when a person inherits property from any one of his three immediate paternal ancestors, his sons, grandsons and great grandsons acquire an interest in it by birth can have any application to the case of these grants which are in the nature of a remuneration for the performance of certain services by the holder of that of fice.\\r\\nA ghatwali has to be regarded as something connected with an office and as observed by Lord Sumner in the above mentioned case, the office cannot except by special custom, grant or other arrangement, either run with lands or be served from them.\\r\\nIn other words, just as primogeniture and impartibility are handmaids, similarly the ghatwal \\'s office and the ghatwali tenure are two inseparables and cannot be lodged in separate compartments.\\r\\nIf the office cannot be in the nature of coparcenary property, the tenure must follow the same way.\\r\\nThus it is not easy to conceive that an inter est (1) (1924) 51 I.A. 37.\\r\\n164 can be acquired at the birth of a member of a joint family in a tenure which is annexed to an office, even if it has descended from three immediate paternal ancestors.\\r\\nIn certain eventualities the selection of the next heir depends on the choice of the ruling authority and in case of miscon duct or misbehaviour of the holder for the time being the ruling power can not only dismiss the ghatwal but even resume the tenure.\\r\\nThis is a feature which places this heritable property in a class by itself as distinguished from other inheritances governed by the Mitakshara law.\\r\\nThe view that in Birbhum, ghatwali tenures are in the nature of separate property or the exclusive property of the ghatwal finds support from the fact that in many instances, whenever succession has opened out in respect of them, it has been determined according to the Mitakshara rule ap plicable to the devolution of separate property irrespective of the circumstance whether the deceased died in joint or separate status with the other members of the family.\\r\\nThirteen instances of such practice in the past amongst members of the Bais Chaurasi clan were proved in the case, in all of which the widow succeeded in preference to a male heir.\\r\\nThe learned trial Judge held that in some of these instances the female succeeded because the agnate nearest in line was separate from her husband; as regards the others though he reached the conclusion that the evidence of sepa ration was weak, he thought that these did not establish a custom superseding in cases of joint family property the rule of survivorship.\\r\\nThe High Court was of a different opinion.\\r\\nIt rightly remarked that while numerous instances of female succession to the estates held by Baisi Chaurasi gaddidar \\'s had been proved, not a single instance of a female having been excluded from the appointment of a ghat wal on the ground of an agnate being entitled to come in as a coparcener of the last holder by survivorship had been proved, and that in these circumstances there was force in the contention that even if the tenures in question were ancestral joint family property, succession thereto was 165 governed by the Mitakshara rule applicable to separate property.\\r\\nFor the reasons given above we held that the Mitakshara rule that the property inherited by a person from his imme diate paternal ancestors becomes ancestral in his hands and in it his sons, grandsons and great grandsons acquire a right at the moment of the birth has no apposite application to Birbhum ghatwali tenures.\\r\\nThe learned counsel for the appellant in support of his contention placed reliance on a number of decisions of their Lordships of the Privy Council concerning impartible estates governed by the Mitakshara law, wherein it was held that the succession to an impartible estate which is the ancestral property of a joint Hindu family governed by the Mitakshara law is governed by the rule of survivorship subject to the custom of impartibility; the eldest member of the senior branch of the family succeeding in preference to the direct lineal senior descendants of the common ancestor, if the latter is more remote in degree.\\r\\nParticular reference was made to the remarks of Turner L. I. in the Sivaganga case(1), and to the observations in Baijnath Prasad Singh vs Tej Bali Singh (2) and in the case of Shiba Prasad Singh vs Rani Prayag Kumari Debi(3).\\r\\nTherein it was said that in the case of ordinary joint family property the members Of the family have (1) the right of partition, (2) the right to restrain alienations by the head, (3) the right of mainte nance, and (4) the right of survivorship.\\r\\nThe first of these rights cannot exist in the case of an impartible estate, though ancestral, from the very nature of the estate.\\r\\nThe second and third are incompatible with the custom of impart ibility.\\r\\nTo this extent the general law of the Mitakshara has been superseded by custom and the impartible estate, though ancestral, is clothed with the incidents of self acquired and separate property.\\r\\nBut the right of survivor ship is not inconsistent with the custom of impartibility.\\r\\nThis right (1) (1861 3) 9 M.I.A. 543.\\r\\n(3) A.I.R. 1932 P.C. 216.\\r\\n(2) All.\\r\\n22 166 therefore still remains and to this extent the estate still retain.s its character of joint family property and its devolution is governed by the general Mitakshara law applicable to such property and that though the other rights which a coparcener acquires by birth in joint family proper ty no longer exist, the birthright of the senior member to take by survivorship still remains.\\r\\nIn our view, these observations have no application to the tenures in suit.\\r\\nAs already indicated, it is not possi ble to concede in their case that a member of a joint family governed by the Mitakshara law acquires any right by birth in them.\\r\\nThe general law of Mitakshara creating that right seems to have been superseded in their case not only by peculiarities inherent in the nature of these tenures but by encroachments of custom on it.\\r\\nMoreover, it appears that the remarks relied upon were made in cases where the impartible estates were admittedly joint family property or the grants were of such a character that they are intended for the benefit of the family as such.\\r\\nThe ratio of these decisions was that even though certain incidents attaching to joint family property may cease to exist by custom, some others which are not affected by custom may survive.\\r\\nThis reasoning can have no application to property which at no stage what ever could be clothed or was clothed with any of the inci dents of coparcenary property.\\r\\nThe learned counsel for the appellant placed considera ble reliance on the observations of Sir Dawson Miller C.J. in Fulbati Kumari vs Maheshwari Prasad(1).\\r\\nThe learned Chief Justice therein dissented from the View urged before him that all ghatwali property is the exclusive separate property of the holder for the time being and that it de volves according to the rules affecting separate property subject again to the circumstance of impartibility.\\r\\nHe observed that the fact that a raj is impartible does not in a case governed by the Mitakshara law make it separate or self acquired property, that it may be self acquired (1) A. I. R. 1923 Pat.\\r\\n167 property or it may be the property of a joint undivided family and that in the latter case succession will be regu lated according to the rule of survivorship.\\r\\nIn our opinion, these observations have no application to the case of Birb hum ghatwalis because in express terms these were excluded from consideration in that case.\\r\\nIn the judgment it was said : \"In our opinion, the estate in the present case is in no way comparable to the Birbhum ghatwali tenures and Regula tion XXIX of 1814 does not apply to it.\" The decision in the case proceeded on the assumption that Birbhum ghatwalis stood apart from other ghatwalis which stood on the same footing as impartible estates gov erned by Mitakshara law.\\r\\nThe learned Attorney General challenged the correctness of these decisions and contended that the decisions of the Privy Council on this subject were not uniform.\\r\\nHe drew our attention to the observations made in Sartaj Kuari \\'s case(1), in the Second Pittapur case(2), and in Tipperah case(3).\\r\\nThere may be a seeming conflict between the view expressed in those decisions and the view expressed in Baijnath Prasad Singh vs Tej Bali Singh(4), and in Shiba Prasad Singh vs Rani Prayag Kurnari Debi(5).\\r\\nIt seems to us however that these latter cases have settled the law ap plicable to joint family impartible estates governed by Mitakshara law and it is rather late in the day to reopen a controversy settled by a series of decisions of the Privy Council.\\r\\nThe contention that on the death of the last holder a ghatwali tenure in Birbhum reverts to the grantor and that notionally there is a resumption of it in favour of govern ment and a re grant to the next heir does not impress us.\\r\\nOn the express terms of the regulation these tenures are heritable from generation to generation and the theory of resumption and re grant is inconsistent with their heritable character.\\r\\nInheritance can never remain in abeyance and on the (1) (4) All.\\r\\n(2) (1918) 45 I.A. 148.\\r\\n(5) A.I.R. 1932 P.C. 216.\\r\\n(3) (1867 9) 12 M.I.A. 523.\\r\\n168 death of the last holder the estate immediately vests in the next heir.\\r\\nThe circumstance that the government may in certain events have the power to dismiss a ghatwal or to forfeit the tenure cannot lead to the inference that it terminates and is re granted at every death.\\r\\nThe argument of the learned counsel for the appellant that a widow not being a descendant of the grantee under the terms of Regulation XXIX of 1814, is not entitled to inherit to Birbhum ghatwali tenures also does not impress us.\\r\\nThe regulation does not enact any rule of succession to these tenures, and the devolution with respect to them is admit tedly determined by personal law or custom.\\r\\nThe expression \"descendants\" used in the regulation cannot deprive females, like a widow or a mother, from taking the inheritance where they are legal heirs under Mitakshara law or under custom.\\r\\nFemales have invariably been allowed to succeed to these tenures in the past.\\r\\nThe appellant \\'s counsel conceded that if the property was the separate property of Kali Prasad Singh, the defendant was entitled to inherit to it.\\r\\nWe think that the expression \"descendants\" has been loosely employed in the regulation for the word \"heirs\".\\r\\nOn this point we are in agreement with the observations made by a Bench of the Calcutta High Court in Chhatradhari Singh vs Saraswyati Kumari(1).\\r\\nIt may further be pointed out that even if the conten tion of the learned counsel for the appellant is to be accepted, by no process could the trial court have passed a decree in favour of the plaintiff in respect of items 4, 5 and 6 of the schedule Admittedly these were acquired by Krishna Prasad Singh, father of Kali Prasad Singh by a decree of court passed in his favour against his collateral Katku Singh who also claimed these properties as an heir to the last male owner Banwari Singh (vide Exhibit 4).\\r\\nThese pro perties having devolved upon Krishna Prasad Singh by obstructed heritage, were in the nature of separate property in his hands and could not fall within the (1) Cal.\\r\\n156. 169 definition of ancestral property given in Mitakshara.\\r\\nSarju Prasad Singh, uncle of Krishna Prasad Singh, could acquire no right or roterest in these properties by birth enabling him to claim them by survivorship.\\r\\nKali Prasad Singh who inherited them on the death of his father got them as his separate property as he had no son who could acquire any interest in them by birth.\\r\\nWith regard to this property the widow was certainly an heir after the death of her husband \\' and plaintiff could have no claim whatsoever in respect of these items of the schedule.\\r\\nThis aspect of the case seems to have been lost sight of in the two courts below.\\r\\nThe result, therefore, is that this appeal fails and is dismissed with costs.\\r\\nFAZL ALI J.\\r\\nWhile agreeing generally with my learned brother Mahajan J., I wish to say a few words to indicate the main ground on which I would dismiss this appeal.\\r\\nThere are a number of authoritative decisions dealing with the special features of ghatwali property, one of which is said to be that if the ghatwal is a member of a joint family, the family has no right over the property while it is in his hands.\\r\\n[See Durga Prashad Singh vs Tribeni Singh(1)].\\r\\nThe logical corollary from this characteristic of ghatwali property would seem to be that it is more in the nature of exclusive property of the ghatwal than of joint family property.\\r\\nNevertheless, in some cases, succession to such property has been determined with reference to the rules of Hindu law regarding joint property, where the ghatwal was found to be a member of the joint family.\\r\\nAs at present advised I am not prepared to say that those cases were wrongly decided, but I think it will not be incorrect to say that custom and usage are also important factors governing succession to ghatwali property, and it is con ceivable that while in some cases custom may develop on the lines of Hindu law relating to succession owing to repeated instances of (1) (1918) 45 I.A. 251. 170 tacit and unquestioned application of the law, in other i.a cases succession to ghatwali property may be governed not entirely by Hindu law but by such law as modified in certain respects by usage and custom.\\r\\nThe question with which we are concerned in this case is whether the widow of a deceased ghatwal, who was a member of a joint family and died leaving no issue or direct male descendants, can succeed to the ghatWali property in prefer ence to the nearest male agnate.\\r\\nOn a reference to the plaint, it would appear that what the plaintiff contended was that the clan to which the parties belong was governed by the Mitakshara school of Hindu law \"subject to their clan custom\", one of which was said to be that females, viz., widow, daughter or mother, and persons claiming through females could not and did not succeed on the death of the ghatwal.\\r\\nThis allegation was controverted in the written statement, and it was claimed that the family was governed by the Mitakshara system of law and \"there was no clan custom governing the estate in suit.\\r\\n\" Upon these pleadings, one of the issues framed by the trial court was \"whether succession to the ghatwali is governed by custom, as alleged in paragraph 7 of the plaint.\" In the course of the trial, the plaintiff tried to prove that females were always excluded as alleged by him.\\r\\nIn this, he did not succeed.\\r\\nThe courts below however found that the question which directly affected the present case was a much narrower one, namely, whether females could succeed even when the family was joint.\\r\\nSo far as this question is con cerned, both the courts below are agreed that females cannot be excluded if the property is the separate property of the ghatwal.\\r\\nBut the question which still remains to be decided is what the true legal position would be if the property is deemed to be joint property.\\r\\nIt appears that evidence was adduced at the trial to show that in 13 instances affecting the Baisi Chaurasi clan to whom the Birbhum ghatwals admit tedly belong, the widow of the last ghatwal succeeded in preference to a male agnate.\\r\\n171 The trial judge however found that in four of these in stances the nearest agnate who claimed the property was separate from the ghatwal or his widow, but, in the other instances, there was no evidence of separation, or \"the evidence was weak\", which, I take it, is another way of saying that it could not be safely relied on.\\r\\nIt seems to me that these instances lend some support to the view that Hindu law has been modified \\' by custom, so far as the Birb hum ghatwalis are concerned, and that among the ghatwals belonging to this class, where the last ghatwal dies leaving a widow but no issue, then she succeeds in preference to the nearest male agnate, even though the family may be joint.\\r\\nThe Birbhum ghatwals form a class by themselves, and they are also subject to a special Regulation Regulation XXIX of 1814.\\r\\nThat Regulation states among other things that this class of ghatwals shall be entitled to hold the ghatwali property generation after generation and that they and their descendants in perpetuity shall be maintained in possession of such property.\\r\\nStrictly speaking, neither a widow nor a distant agnate will come within the terms of the Regulation, not being a descendant of the last ghatwal, and therefore custom and usage cannot be ruled out in determining succes sion in such cases.\\r\\nThe strongest case which was relied upon by the appellant is Fulbati Kumari vs Maheshwari Pra sad(1) where it was laid down that on the death of a ghat wal, who was a member of a joint family, the ghatwali property would devolve according to the rules of Hindu law affecting joint property, that iS to say, by the rule of survivorship.\\r\\nBut, in this case, Dawson Miller C.J. who delivered the judgment, took care to observe that the ghat wali estate which was the subject of litigation was not comparable to the Birbhum ghatwali \\'tenures, which means that the rule laid down in that case may not apply to Birb hum ghatwals.\\r\\nIn the present case, the Commissioner, who represented the Government and who had special means of knowing the usages affecting the Birbhurn ghatwals.\\r\\n(1) A.I.R. 1923 Pat.\\r\\n453. 172 appointed the respondent as the ghatwal, stating that he was \"following a well established precedent in the case of these ghatwals by recognizing the widow in the absence of a direct heir.\\r\\n\" In my opinion, whatever evidence there is in this case supports the Commissioner \\'s view, and there is hardly any cogent evidence to rebut it.\\r\\nIn the circumstances, I agree that this appeal ought to be dis missed with costs.\\r\\nAppeal dismissed.\\r\\nADAMJI UMAR DALAL vs THE STATE

Raman and Raman Ltd., (Petitioners before the High Court) of permits for the five buses in respect of which a joint application had been made original ly by them and one T.D. Balasubramania Pillai.\\r\\nThe present appellant, G. Veerappa Pillai, was the fourth respondent in the High Court.\\r\\nThe present first respondents (Messrs. Raman and Raman Ltd.) were the peti tioners before the High Court Present respondents Nos. 2, 3 and 4 were respectively respondents Nos. 1, 2 and 3 before the High Court.\\r\\nThe dispute is between the appellant and Messrs. Raman and Raman Ltd., who were competing bus proprietors in the Tanjore District; and it is over the issues of five perma nent permits for buses Nos.\\r\\nM.D.O. 81, M.D.O. 230, M.D.O. 6, M.D.O. 7 and M. D.O. 759 on the route between Kumbakonam and Karaikal.\\r\\nIt has been a long drawn game with many moves, counter moves, advances and checkmates, both sides display ing unusual assiduity and skill in their manoeuvres for position.\\r\\nBut it is unnecessary to set out in great detail all the steps taken, as they have been narrated in the order of High Court and many of them are of insignificant rele vance for disposal of this appeal.\\r\\nI shall state here only what is material.\\r\\nThe \\'C \\' permits for the five buses stood originally in the name of Balasubramania Pillai.\\r\\nThe buses were agreed to be purchased from him by Messrs. Raman and Raman Ltd., and there was a joint application by the transferor and trans feree on 10th March, 1944, for transfer of the ownership and of the \\'C \\' permits in the name of the purchasers.\\r\\nTwo days later, Veerappa Pillai, proprietor of the Sri Sathi Viias Bus Service, who is the appellant before us, applied for temporary permits to ply two of his own vehicles over the same route, stating that the vehicles of the two agencies which held the permits were mostly out of action.\\r\\nIt was a fact that out of the five buses sold 586 by Balasubramania Pillai, only two were then running; the other three were under repairs.\\r\\nThe permanent permits for the sold buses were suspended by order of the Secretary dated 28th March, 1944.\\r\\nTemporary permits for buses M.D.O. 920, 894, 918, M.S.C. 7632 and 7482 had been issued to Veerappa Pillai during the same month.\\r\\nNow we come to another chapter in the story.\\r\\nBalasubra mania Pillai resiled from the joint application and repudi ated it as having been got from him by fraud.\\r\\nThe Secre tary, Road Traffic Board, thereupon refused to transfer the ownership on the 19th March, 1944, and this order was con firmed by the Board on 29th May, 1944, Balasubramania Pillai and Veerappa Pillai made a joint application on 10th April, 1944, for transfer of the buses and the original permits in favour of Veerappa Pillai who had on the same date agreed to purchase the vehicles.\\r\\nThe Secretary granted this applica tion on the same date Messrs. Raman and Raman Ltd., took the matter before the Central Road Traffic Board and they made an order on 16th August, 1944, upholding the issue of tempo rary permits to Veerappa Pillai for his buses M.D.O. 920, 894,918, M.S.C. 7632 and 7482, but setting aside the trans fer of registry of the original buses and the transfer of the permits relating to the same.\\r\\nOn an application by Veerappa Pillai to review its order dated 16th August, 1944, the Central Road Traffic Board allowed on 27th November, 1944, only the transfer of the ownership of the buses but not a transfer of the permits.\\r\\nYet another move in the game was this Veerappa Pillai filed a suit in the court of the Subordinate Judge, Kumbako nam, on 3rd October, 1944, for recovery of possession of the original five buses from Messrs. Raman and Raman Ltd., on the strength of his purchase from Balasubramania Pillai.\\r\\nThe Subordinate Judge appointed Veerappa Pillai as Receiver on 17th March, 1945, and the five disputed buses were deliv ered to him on 26th April, 1945.\\r\\nTwo of the buses M.D.O. 6 and 7 were repaired by him and put on the route under his temporary permits.\\r\\nThe suit was decreed in 587 his favour on 2nd May, 1946.\\r\\nLater, he repaired the other three buses M.D.O. 759, 230 and 81 and began to run them on the same route under the temporary permits he held.\\r\\nVeerappa Pillai was discharged from receivership on 18th September, 1946.\\r\\nOn the strength of the Sub Court decree, Veerappa Pillai again applied for a permanent transfer of the permits, and on 22nd July, 1946, the Central Road Traffic Board trans ferred the petition to the Regional Transport Authority with an intimation that it saw no objection to the issue of regular permits to Veerappa Pillai for the disputed buses or to their transfer in his name, provided there were valid permits in existence.\\r\\nThis view appears to have been modi fied later and on 2nd September, 1946, the Regional Trans port Officer directed the issue of temporary permits to the buses for the period from 3rd September, 1946, to 31st October, 1946, subject to the condition that the issue of the permits did not affect the rights of either party in the matter under dispute.\\r\\nThereupon, the Government was moved by Veerappa Pillai and also by Messrs. Raman and Raman Ltd., but the Government declined to interfere and the result was an order on 30th June, 1947, by the Regional Transport Authority to the following effect: \" Since the subject matter is on appeal before the High Court, the matter will lie over pending the decision of the High Court.\\r\\nThe temporary permits are continued as is being done.\" A fresh petition by Veerappa Pillai to the Central Road Traffic Board, Madras, was unsuccessful, but a further appeal to the Government of Madras ended in his favour in an order dated 29th March, 1949.\\r\\nThe order is in these terms : \"Shri Sathi Viias Bus Service, Porayar, Tanjore dis trict, have been permitted by the Regional Transport Author ity, Tanjore, to run their buses M.D.O. 6, 7, 81, 230 and 750 on the Kumbakonam Karaikal route on temporary permits from 1944 pending 588 the High Court \\'s decision on the question of permanent ownership of the buses.\\r\\nGovernment consider it undesirable to keep these buses running on temporary permits for a long and indefinite period.\\r\\nFurther Sri Sathi Vilas Bus Service have secured the decision of the Sub Court, Kumbako nam, in their favour about the permanent ownership of the buses.\\r\\nIn the circumstances the Regional Transport Authori ty, Tanjore, is directed to grant permanent permits for the buses of Sri Sathi Vilas Bus Service, Porayar, referred to above in lieu of the existing temporary permits.\\r\\n\" On the basis of this Government order, permanent permits were issued in favour of Veerappa Pillai on 18th April, 1949.\\r\\nGetting to know of this last order, Messrs. Raman and Raman Ltd.,approached the Government Madras with a petition praying for clarification of the order by making it expressly subject to the decision of the High Court regarding the title to the said five buses and that in the event of the High Court deciding the appeal in favour of Messrs. Raman and Raman Ltd. \"the above said five permanent permits will be taken away from Veerappa Pillai and given to them.\" The Minister of Transport, who dealt with the matter, stated on the petition \"that was my inten tion also.\\r\\n\" The High Court reversed the decree of the Sub Court on 2nd September, 1949, and came to the conclusion that the title of Messrs. Raman and Raman Ltd., to the five buses prevailed over that of Veerappa Pillai.\\r\\nOn 19th September, 1949, they applied to the Government for cancellation of the five permits issued to Veerappa Pillai and for grant of the same to them.\\r\\nThe Government declined to interfere as the Regional Transport Authority was the competent authority, vide order dated 16th November, 1949.\\r\\nIn their application to the Regional \\'Fransport Authority dated 28th November, 1949, Messrs. Raman and Raman Ltd., asked for withdrawal of the permits.\\r\\nIn the meantime, that is on 14th October, 1949, Veerappa Pillai applied for renewal of his permanent permits held for his own 589 buses Nos.\\r\\nM.D.O. 1357, 20, 1366, 1110, 1077, M.D.O. 1368 and M.S.C.7632, which had been substituted for the disputed buses as they had become unroadworthy and useless.\\r\\nThe application for renewal has under section 58, sub clause (2), of the Act to be treated as a fresh application for new permits.\\r\\nThis procedure was followed and on 22nd October, 1949, a notification was issued inviting objections against the renewal and giving 30th November, 1949, as the date of hearing.\\r\\nNo objections were received and the Secretary renewed the permits for two years from 1st January, 1950.\\r\\nThis order was dated 3rd January, 1950.\\r\\nThe Regional Trans port Authority dealing with the application of Messrs. Raman and Raman Ltd., dated 28th November, 1949, resolved on 19th January, 1950, that the permanent permits issued to Veerap pa Pillai should be cancelled, that the route should be declared vacant in respect of the five buses and fresh applications should be invited and dealt with on the merits.\\r\\nThe order further stated that \"in the meanwhile Sri G. Veerappa Pillai and Raman and Raman will be given temporary permits for running two and three buses respectively on the route.\\r\\nThe permanent permits will be cancelled with imme diate effect.\\r\\nRaman and Raman should put in the buses as quickly as possible.\\r\\nTill then Sri Veerappa Pillai will be given temporary permits so as not to dislocate public traf fic.\\r\\n\" Both the parties were dissatisfied with this order and preferred appeals to the Central Road Traffic Board, Madras, which dismissed the appeal of Messrs. Raman and Raman Ltd., and restored the permanent permits of Veerappa Pillai by order dated the 3rd March, 1950.\\r\\nMessrs Raman and Raman Ltd., moved the Government, but it declined to interfere by G.O., dated 7th November, 1950.\\r\\nThereupon, Messrs. Raman and Raman Ltd., moved the High Court on 4th December, 1950, under article 226 of the Constitution in Civil Miscellaneous Petition No. 12215 of 1950 for a writ of certiorari for quashing the orders and the proceedings of the 590 Regional Transport Authority, the Central Road Traffic Board, Madras, and the State of Madras dated 19th January, 1950, 3rd March, 1950, and 7th November, 1950, respectively, and for the issue of a writ of mandamus or other such appro priate directions to the first respondent to transfer, issue or grant \"the five pucca permits in respect of the route Kumbakonam to Karaikkal to the petitioner herein\" (Messrs. Raman and Raman Ltd.) It is on this petition that \\'the order challenged in this appeal was made by the High Court.\\r\\nThe High Court took the view that throughout all the stages prior to the High Court \\'s decree, the parties, the transport authorities vested with the power to issue per mits, and the Government also proceeded upon the footing that the transfer of the permits was dependent on the title to the buses and that Veerappa Pillai obtained the temporary and permanent permits only in his capacity as transferee and not in his individual right.\\r\\nTo quote the learned Chief Justice:\"the conduct of the parties, the attitude of the transport authorities including the Government are all explicable only on the assumption that the rights of parties were consequent on the ownership of the five vehicles in question.\\r\\nThe fourth respondent having obtained the benefit of temporary and permanent permits as a transferee from Balasubramania Pillai all this time cannot be heard now to say after the decision of this Court which has negatived his claim and upheld the claim of the applicant that the appli cant should not enjoy the fruits of his success.\\r\\n\" He further points out that the procedure laid down by the Motor Vehi cles Act and the rules for grant of fresh permits was not followed and that long before the application for renewal was allowed, the Regional Transport Authority had been informed of the decision of the High Court.\\r\\nThe order of the Central Road Traffic Board was in his opinion most unsatis factory, as it was based on a quibbling distinction between \"withdrawal\" and \"cancellation\" of the permits.\\r\\nIn his view, the orders complained against deprived Messrs. Raman and Raman Ltd., of the fruits of the 591 decree obtained by them at the hands of the High Court after much expenditure of time and money.\\r\\nAn examination of the relevant sections of the Motor Vehicles Act does not support the view that the issue of a permit for a bus which falls within the definition of a \"stage carriage \" is necessarily dependent on the ownership of vehicle.\\r\\nAll that is required for obtaining a permit is possession of the bus.\\r\\nAs ownership is not a condition precedent for the grant of permits and as a person can get a permit provided he is in possession of a vehicle which satisfies the requirements of the statute or the rules framed thereunder, we have to hold that the parties and the authorities were labouring under a misconception if they entertained a contrary view.\\r\\nBut the assumption on which they proceeded may perhaps be explained, if not justified, on the ground that it was supposed that the question of ownership of the vehicles had an important or material bearing on the question as to which of them had a preferen tialclaim for the permits.\\r\\nIt may well be it Was one of the factors to be taken into account and it seems to us that this was apparently the reason why the question of issue of permanent permits was postponed from time to time till we come to the order of the Government dated 29th March, on petitions presented by both the contestants.\\r\\nIf matters had stood as they were till the Government had made this order, something could have been said in favour of Messrs. Raman and Raman Ltd., in the event of their ultimate success in the High Court as regards the title to the five buses.\\r\\nBut the said order altered the situation.\\r\\nIn the order, the direction for the grant of permanent permits is not rested solely on the decision of the Sub Court in favour of Veerappa Pillai but another reason was also given, namely, that Government considered it undesirable to keep the buses running on temporary permits for a long and indefinite period.\\r\\nIn giving this reason, they were stating a policy.\\r\\n77 592 As observed already, the High Court by their judg ment dated 2nd September, 1949, reversed the decree of the Subordinate Judge and dismissed Veerappa Pillai \\'s suit for possession of the buses based on his title.\\r\\nIf it were the law that the question of possession based on ownership was decisive as regards the grant of permits, and if no other circumstances were available to be taken into account when the question of the issue of permanent permits again came up for consideration, it would have been easy to hold that Messrs. Raman and Raman Ltd., had at least a preferential claim.\\r\\nBut unfortunately for them, both these requisites are not satisfied.\\r\\nIt has been point ed out already that nowhere do we find in the Act anything to indicate that the issue of permits depends on ownership.\\r\\nOther circumstances which had a material bear ing as to which of them was entitled to the permits had come into existence since the date of the original joint application and were taken into account by the transport authorities and by the Government.\\r\\nThe order of 19th January, 1950, of the Regional Transport Authority sought to render rough and ready justice between the par ties by the adoption of what may be called a middle course.\\r\\nThe terms of the order have already been set out.\\r\\nBefore disposing of the appeals of both the parties, the Central Traffic Board appears to have called for a report from the Regional Transport Officer.\\r\\nIn this report, attention was drawn to the fact that all the five buses had been replaced by new vehicles and that the registration certificates had been cancelled as a result of the replacement.\\r\\nAfter Balasubramania Pillai, it was Veerappa Pillai who was running the buses continuously on this route for nearly 5 years and he also obtained the privilege of securing the permanent permits.\\r\\nThe Central Traffic Board \\'s order of 3rd March, 1950, restoring the permanent permits of Veerappa Pillai was based on the fact that Messrs. Raman and Raman Ltd. asked for withdrawal of the permits and not their cancellation and that no opportunity had been given to Veerappa Pillai to show cause why his permits should not be cancelled; and 593 the procedure prescribed for cancellation was not followed.\\r\\nWhen the Government was moved by Messrs. Raman and Raman Ltd., under section 64 (a) of the Motor Vehicles Act, they had before them a petition for withdrawal of the perma nent permits issued to Veerappa Pillai and for transfer or grant of five \\'pucca permits \\' relating to the five buses.\\r\\nThe Government granted stay of the appellate order of the Central Road Traffic Board pending disposal of the revision petition \\'and called for a report from the subordinate trans port authorities.\\r\\nTwo important facts were brought to the notice of the Government in the report Messrs. Raman and Raman Ltd. did not file any objections to the renewal of the permits sought by Veerappa Pillai.\\r\\nWhat is more important, they had no permits from the French authorities enabling them to run any buses on the portion of the route which lay in French territory.\\r\\nIt was further pointed out that there was no subsisting joint application to support the request for transfer and that the original permits in the name of Bala. subramanian had ceased to exist after 31st December 1944.\\r\\nThe Government had also before them two petitions dated 8th March, 1950, and 25th October, 1950, from Messrs Raman and Raman Ltd. and two petitions dated 29th March, 1950, and 8th June, 1950, from Veerappa Pillai.\\r\\nIt is on the basis of all these materials that the Government de clined to interfere with the decision of the Central Road Traffic Board.\\r\\nIt is contended for the appellant that in this state of affairs the High Court acting under Article 226 of the Constitution had no right to interfere with the orders of the transport authorities.\\r\\nIt is unnecessary for the disposal of this appeal to consider and decide on the exact scope and extent of the jurisdiction of the High Court under Article 226.\\r\\nWhether the writs it can issue must be analogous to the writs of habeas corpus, mandamus, prohibition, quo warranto and certiorari specified therein and the power is subject to all the limitations, or restrictions 594 imposed on the exercise of this jurisdiction, or whether the High Court is at liberty to issue any \"suitable directions or orders or writs untramelled ,by any condi tions, whenever the interests of justice so require, is a large and somewhat difficult problem which does not arise for solution now.\\r\\nMr. Setalvad appearing for the appellant urged two narrower grounds as sufficient for his purposes.\\r\\nFirstly, he urged that however wide the jurisdiction of the High Court might be under Article 226, it could never exer cise its powers under the article in such a manner as to convert itself into a court of appeal sitting in judgment over every tribunal or authority in the State discharging administrative or quasi judicial functions.\\r\\nSecondly, he maintained that the Motor Vehicles Act with the rules framed thereunder dealing with the grant of permits is a self contained code and that in respect of the rights and liabil ities created by such a statute the manner of enforcement must be sought within the statute itself.\\r\\nIt was further urged by him that in any event, the High Court could not substitute its own view or discretion for the view taken or discretion exercised by the specified authorities, even if it was erroneous or unsound.\\r\\nSuch writs as are referred to in Article 226 are obvi ously intended to enable the High Court to issue them in grave cases where the subordinate tribunals or bodies or officers act wholly without jurisdiction, or in excess of it, or in violation of the principles of natural justice, or refuse to exercise a jurisdiction vested in them, or there is an error apparent on the face of the record, and such act, omission, error, or excess has resulted in manifest injustice.\\r\\nHowever extensive the jurisdiction may be, it seems to us that it is not so wide or large as to enable the High Court to convert itself into a Court of appeal and examine for itself the correctness of the decision impugned and decide what is the proper view to be taken or the order to be made Mr. Daphtary, who appeared for the respondent, said nothing to controvert this position.\\r\\nHis argument 595 was that if all along the authorities and the Government had proceeded upon a particular footing and dealt with the rights of the parties on that basis, it was not open to them afterwards to change front and give the go by altogether to the conception of the rights of parties entertained by them till then.\\r\\nAccording to him, there was manifest injustice to his client in allowing them to do so and this was the reason which impelled the High Court to make the order which is the subject matter of challenge in this appeal.\\r\\nThe Motor Vehicles Act is a statute which creates new rights and liabilities and prescribes an elaborate procedure for their regulation.\\r\\nNo one is entitled to a permit as of right even if he satisfies all the prescribed conditions.\\r\\nThe grant of a permit is entirely within the discretion of the transport authorities and naturally depends on several circumstances which have to be taken into account.\\r\\nThe Regional Transport Authority and the Provincial Transport Authority are entrusted under section 42 with this power.\\r\\nThey may be described as administrative bodies exercising quasijudicial functions in the matter of the grant of per mits.\\r\\nUnder rule 8 of the Madras Motor Vehicles Rules the Regional Transport Authority is called the Road Traffic Board and the Provincial Transport Authority is called the Central Road Traffic Board.\\r\\nThese bodies or authorities are constituted by the Provincial \\' Government.\\r\\nThe matters which are to be taken into account in granting or refusing a stage carriage permit are specified in section 47.\\r\\nBy delegation under rule 134 A, the Secretary of the Road Traf fic Board may exercise certain powers as regards the grant or refusal of stage carriage permits and under rule 136 there is an appeal to the Board from these orders.\\r\\nSimilar powers of delegation are vested in the Secretary to the Central Board and an appeal lies to the Central Board under rule 148(1).\\r\\nFrom an original order of the Road Traffic Board there is an appeal to the Central Board and from the original orders of the Central Board to the Government, vide rules 147 and 148 An amendment introduced by the Madras Act XX of 1948 596 and found as section 64 A in the Act vests a power of revi sion in the Provincial Government.\\r\\nBesides this specific provision, there is a general provision in section 43 A that the Provincial Government may issue such orders and direc tions of a general character as it may consider necessary to the Provincial Transport Authority or a Regional Transport Authority in respect of any matter relating to road trans port; and such transport authority shall give effect to all such orders and directions.\\r\\nThere is, therefore, a regular hierarchy of administrative bodies established to deal with the regulation of transport by means of motor vehicles.\\r\\nThus we have before us a complete and precise scheme for regulating the issue of permits, providing what matters are to be taken into consideration as relevant, and prescribing appeals and revisions from subordinate bodies to higher authorities.\\r\\nThe remedies for the redress of grievances or the correction of errors are found in the statute itself and it is to these remedies that resort must generally be had.\\r\\nAs observed already, the issue or refusal of permits is solely within the discretion of the transport authorities and it is not a matter of right.\\r\\nWe are accordingly of opinion that this was not a case for interference with the discretion that was exercised by the Transport Authorities paying regard to all the facts and the surrounding circumstances.\\r\\nFurther, it will be noticed that the High Court here did not content itself with merely quashing the proceedings, it went further and directed the Regional Transport Authority, Tanjore, \"to grant to the petitioner permits in respect of the five buses in respect of which a joint application was made originally by the petitioner and Balasubramania Pillai and that in case the above buses have been condemned, the petitioner shall be at liberty to provide substitutes within such time as may be prescribed by the authorities.\\r\\n\" Such a direction was clearly in excess of its powers and jurisdic tion.\\r\\n597 For the reasons given above, the appeal is allowed and the order of the High Court set aside.\\r\\nEach party will bear their own costs of these proceedings throughout.\\r\\nAppeal allowed.\\r\\nAgent for respondent No. 1:

Sinha (G.C. Mathur, with him), for the appellant.\\r\\nK.B. Asthana, for the respondent.\\r\\nDecember 20.\\r\\nThe Judgment of the Court was deliv ered by FAZL ALl J.\\r\\nThis is an appeal against a judgment of the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad reversing the decision of the Sessions Judge of Aligarh in a criminal case.\\r\\nThe appellants were tried by the Sessions Judge on charges under section 302 read with section 149, section 148, sections 325 and 326 read with section 149, and section 201 of the Indian Penal Code, but were acquitted.\\r\\nOn appeal by the State Government, the High Court reversed the Sessions Judge \\'s decision, and convicted the appellants and sentenced them to transportation for life under section 302 read with section 149, to five years \\' rigorous imprisonment under sections 325 and 326 read with section 149, and to two years \\' rigorous imprisonment under section 147 of the Indian Penal Code, all the sentences being made to run concurrently.\\r\\nThe appellants thereafter applied to the Privy Council for special leave, which was granted on the 28th October, 1947.\\r\\nThe facts which were put before the court on behalf of the prosecution may be briefly stated as follows.\\r\\nThere is a plot No. 518 in Nagaria Patti Chaharum, village Shahgarh in the district of Aligarh which is about 30 bighas in area and is known as the \"teesa\" field.\\r\\nThis plot was the \"sir\" land of several landlords including Mst.\\r\\nBhagwati Kuer and Ratan Singh and had been let out to certain tenants.\\r\\nIn 1944, Mst.\\r\\nBhagwati Kuer, Ratan Singh and their co sharers filed a suit for the ejectment of the tenants, and the 195 suit was decreed.\\r\\nOn the 7th June, 1945, possession over the plot was delivered by the Amin to Surajpal Singh, the first appellant, who was the mukhtar i Am of Mst.\\r\\nBhagwati Kuer.\\r\\nIt was contended on behalf of Surajpal Singh that he took possession on behalf of all the co sharers, but certain statements made by Ratan Singh in his evidence do not sup port this contention.\\r\\nHowever that may be, it appears that on the 17th June, 1945, Ratan Singh reported to the police that he had sent his labourers to irrigate the \"teesa\" field, and while they were irrigating it Surajpal Singh and certain other persons came and tried to stop the irrigation and damaged the ploughs of Ratan Singh.\\r\\nOn the 18th June, at about 7 A.M., the occurrence which is the subject matter of the present trial took place.\\r\\nThe prosecution version of the occurrence was that while Ratan Singh \\'s labourers were working in the field under the supervision of one Behari Singh, the appellants with many other persons came armed with guns, spears and lathis, and some of the members of the appellants \\' party entered the field, cut off the nosestrings of the bullocks and abused and assaulted the labourers, most of whom ran away.\\r\\nThereupon, Deva Sukh, who was there to supply water to the labourers, protested and was beaten with lathis.\\r\\nAt that point of time, Behari Singh and 10 to 15 persons came and fight took place between the parties.\\r\\nDuring the fight, one of the accused persons, Rajendra Singh, a young lad, fired his gun twice in the air, and thereafter Surajpal Singh took the gun from him and fired two shots hitting Nawab Mewati, who died instantaneously, and Behari Singh, who died later in the day.\\r\\nThree other persons, Zorawar, Rajpal and Lakhan also received gun shot injuries.\\r\\nSometime later, Surajpal Singh along with the other three appellants came to the spot and removed the dead body of Nawab in a cart.\\r\\nThe body was thrown into a river and was recovered on the 20th June, 1945.\\r\\nAfter investiga tion 25 persons including the appellants were sent up for trial.\\r\\nAfter hearing the evidence in the case, the Ses sions Judge delivered judgment on the 20th February, 1946.\\r\\n196 He held that the \"teesa\" field was in the possession of Surajpal Singh, that Behari Singh and Ratan Singh \\'s men were aggressors and wished to take forcible possession of the field, that when resisted they had attacked the appellants \\' party, that the person who fired the gun had done so in self defence and not with a view to killing Behari Singh and Nawab Mewati, and that the evidence adduced by the prosecu tion was so unsatisfactory that it was unsafe to convict the accused upon it.\\r\\nAs to the charge of concealing evidence of the offence of murder by the removal of the dead body of Nawab, the Sessions Judge expressed the opinion that in order to convict a person on that charge it must be proved that the offence, the evidence of which the accused is alleged to have caused to disappear had actually been com mitted, but since in the present case the charge of murder was not proved the accused could not be convicted for having caused disappearance of evidence connected with it.\\r\\nThe Judge also held that the evidence being unreliable the charge under section 201 of the Indian Penal Code had not been established beyond reasonable doubt.\\r\\nThe High Court delivered its judgment on the 8th May, 1947, allowing the appeal of the State Government.\\r\\nShortly stated, the conclusion arrived at by the High Court was that Ratan Singh had as much right to the possession of the field as Bhagwati Kuer, that both parties were trying to take exclusive possession of the field, that both parties were prepared for all contingencies to vindicate and enforce their rights, and hence the question of possession was wholly immaterial and no right of private defence could be successfully pleaded by the appellants.\\r\\nA perusal of the two judgments before us shows that while the Sessions Judge took great pains to discuss all the important aspects of the case and to record his opinion on every material point, the learned Judges of the High Court have reversed his decision without displacing the very substantial reasons given by him in support of his conclu sion.\\r\\nThe difference in the treatment of the case by the two courts below 197 is particularly noticeable in the manner in which they have dealt with the prosecution evidence.\\r\\nWe find that while the Sessions Judge took up the evidence of each witness and recorded his finding with regard to his credibility after discussing the minutest details of the evidence, all that the learned Judges of the High Court have to say about the prosecution evidence as a whole is as follows : \"In Prag Dat \\'s case their Lordships observed: usual in cases of this kind the police have found it difficult to secure independent testimony of what did take place.\\r\\nThose of the villagers who were present and looking on would probably by sympathy and bias be so attached to one or other of the disputing parties that it would be hopeless to get disinterested and reliable evidence from them. \\' This difficulty the police find in most riot cases and this case is not free from it.\\r\\nBut as in Prag Dat \\'s case, in this case there are four witnesses, viz., Deo Sukh, Rori Singh, Ram Singh, and Ratan Singh, who could be characte rised as independent witnesses and they support the case for the prosecution, in the main.\\r\\nIn our judgment their testimo ny is on the whole worthy of credence and sufficient to justify the conviction of the respondents.\\r\\n\" In view of the summary treatment of the evidence by the High Court, we had to read the evidence adduced in the case with great care, and what we find is that the four witness es, whose evidence has been accepted by the High Court, are just the persons against whom very serious criticism was offered by the Sessions Judge.\\r\\nOf these witnesses, Ratan Singh not being an eye witness may be ruled out.\\r\\nAs to the remaining witnesses, we are on the whole inclined to agree with the view expressed by the Sessions Judge.\\r\\nAccording to the Sessions Judge, the manner in which Deva Sukh was brought into the picture and the circumstances attendant on his evidence, furnish strong reasons.\\r\\nfor rejecting the prosecution version.\\r\\nWhat has been held is that the whole case of the prosecution 26 198 that Deva Sukh had received injuries in the course of the alleged occurrence was false and his injuries \"were made up so as to create evidence of private defence\" to be utilized by the prosecution to meet the charge of having caused injuries to the members of the appellants \\' party.\\r\\nIt has been established that at least four persons on the side of the accused had received injuries.\\r\\nMahindarpal had received no less than 16 injuries, and his condition was serious for some time.\\r\\nKaran Singh had 12 injuries, one of which was grievous.\\r\\nHari Singh had received 7 injuries including a grievous injury, and Nikka Singh also was injured, his injury having been noticed by the investigating sub inspec tor.\\r\\nIn the prosecution evidence, it was stated that many of the accused persons were armed with lathis and had used them, and it would be strange if it was not proved that any of the persons on their side had any injuries attributable to lathis.\\r\\nIt has been established that the four injured persons of Ratan Singh \\'s party, viz., Rajpal Singh, Lakhan Singh, Behari Singh and Zorawar Singh, had only gun shot wounds.\\r\\nA serious question which arises in this case is at what stage the gun was used, and whether it was used in self defence after the members of the appellants \\' party were assaulted with lathis or it was used before they were as saulted.\\r\\nThe prosecution witnesses had to admit that at first a gun was fired twice in the air and then the actual firing took place.\\r\\nThis version of the firing lends support to the defence story that the gun was fired in self defence when Ratan Singh \\'s men attacked members of the accused \\'s party.\\r\\nThe Sessions Judge has expressed the view that in order to meet the defence case the prosecution introduced the story of Deva Sukh having been assaulted with a lathi in the first instance so as to make the appellants \\' party the aggressors, it being the prosecution case that Behari Singh and his men had used lathis in order to defend themselves.\\r\\nIn order to resolve the conflict in the cases of the parties and to get at the true picture, the 199 Sessions Judge went very minutely into the question as to whether there was trustworthy evidence about Deva Sukh having received any injury at all in the occurrence.\\r\\nIt seems to us that there is a formidable array of circum stances to support the conclusion ultimately reached by the Sessions Judge.\\r\\nIt appears that in the first information report there is no reference to Deva Sukh or to the injuries said to have been received by him.\\r\\nThe Sessions Judge has pointed out that there was a considerable interval of time between the occurrence and the lodging of the first informa tion report, and therefore it is surprising that the most important incident of the occurrence and the name of the most important witness was omitted in the report.\\r\\nAgain, no reference was made to Deva Sukh or to his injuries in the dying declaration of Behari Singh which was recorded by one Dr. Shankar Deo, and also in that of Lakhan Singh.\\r\\nThe Sessions Judge has further pointed out that the prosecution witnesses, Chokha, Prempal, Cheta and Gangola Singh, who were examined by the investigating officer on the 18th June, did not also refer to Deva Sukh.\\r\\nThe investigating sub inspector was informed of the injuries on Deva Sukh and his presence at the time of the occurrence for the first time on the 19th June, 1945, and Deva Sukh \\'s explanation for not appearing before him at the earliest opportunity was that he was frightened and had concealed himself in his house for about two days and had directed his relations not to inform the police of his presence.\\r\\nHe also stated that on his arrival in his house after the occurrence he did not inform his relations of what had happened.\\r\\nSome of these matters might have been overlooked if there had been convincing evidence about his having actually received injuries, but we are satisfied that such evidence as is before us is extreme ly unsatisfactory and suspicious and we entertain grave doubts as to whether Deva Sukh received any injuries at all.\\r\\nDr. Shanker Deo, who examined Deva Sukh, is a retired Sub Assistant Surgeon practising in Kauiraganj, which is not far from village Shahgarh.\\r\\n200 He admits that he had known Ratan Singh since his childhood, and when he was a child he used to be taught at the house of Ratan Singh by a teacher employed by Ratan Singh \\'s uncle.\\r\\nHe has stated that Deva Sukh had two bruises across the back of the middle of the left forearm, and one of them was grievous since the left ulna was fractured.\\r\\nHe further says that at the time of examination he did charge fees from Deva Sukh, that he was brought to him three days after the other injured persons, that when the latter group of persons came to him none of them told him that there was one more injured person to be examined, and that Deva Sukh was brought to him by Ratan Singh \\'s servant.\\r\\nThere are unsatisfactory fea tures in the evidence of this doctor relating to other matters which need not be referred to, but what is somewhat remarkable is that though there is a District Board Hospital at Jalali about four miles from Kauirganj, Deva Sukh did not obtain an injury certificate from the doctor in charge of that hospital.\\r\\nDeva Sukh says that he did go to that hospi tal to have his injuries attended to, but there is no evi dence to corroborate this.\\r\\nThese facts as well as a number of other facts relied upon by the Sessions Judge do go to support his theory, and once it is held that the prosecution has to rely on fabricated evidence, it throws doubts on the entire case.\\r\\nFrom the record, it appears that Surajpal Singh was the person who had been taking an active interest in the eject ment suit, and he was admittedly spending money.\\r\\nRatan Singh says that he had also paid money to Surajpal Singh towards the expenditure, but this is not probable because he and Surajpal had been on bad terms.\\r\\nIt is admitted that Suraj pal is the person to whom the Amin gave possession of the land, but in spite of this fact, Ratan Singh \\'s men started operations on the land ignoring Bhagwati Kuer, which Ratan Singh had no right to do, even assuming that the land was joint property.\\r\\nIf Behari Singh and the other men sent by Ratan Singh were trying to take exclusive possession of the land and had started 201 operations thereon, Surajpal Singh had every right to pro test, and if his men were beaten first, of which there are strong indications in the case, he was entitled \\' to repel the attack in exercise of the right of private defence.\\r\\nThat Ratan Singh had made ample preparations through Behari Singh is quite clear.\\r\\nAdmittedly, there were a number of persons armed with lathis present at the scene on his behalf including outsiders like Nawab Mewati, who is said to have been a well known fighter, Zorawar and others.\\r\\nAs regards the remaining two witnesses, to whom the High Court has made reference, viz., Rori Singh and Pransukh, it seems to us that the High Court has overlooked the comments made by the Sessions Judge upon their evidence, some of which are of considerable force.\\r\\nWhat has impressed us is that they were not independent witnesses and were not mentioned in the first information report as witnesses to the occurrence, and they were examined by the sub inspector as late as the 20th and 21st June, 1945.\\r\\nAfter reading the two judgments, we see no reason why the opinion of the Sessions Judge regarding these witnesses should not receive the weight which should normally be attached to that of the trial court.\\r\\nIt is well established that in an appeal under section 417 of the Criminal Procedure Code, the High Court has full power to review the evidence upon which the order of acquit tal was founded, but it is equally well settled that the presumption of innocence of the accused is further rein forced by his acquittal by the trial court, and the findings of the trial court which had the advantage of seeing the witnesses and hearing their evidence can be reversed only for very substantial and compelling reasons.\\r\\nOn the whole, we are inclined to hold that the Sessions Judge had taken a reasonable view of the facts of the case, and in our opinion there were no good reasons for reversing that view.\\r\\nThe assessors with whose aid the trial was held, were unanimously of the opinion that the accused were not guilty, and 202 though 25 persons were placed on trial on identical evi dence, the State Government preferred an appeal only against 5 of them on the sole ground that the acquittal was against the weight of evidence on the record.\\r\\nIn the result, we allow the appeal, set aside the con viction and sentences of the appellants and acquit them of all the charges.\\r\\nAppeal allowed.\\r\\n', {'entities': [[19, 34, 'CASE_NUMBER'], [94, 107, 'DATE'],

decree for sale on the 17th of February, 1939, for a sum of Rs. 89,485 12 9 plus costs.\\r\\nThe decree was made final on the 22nd of December, 1989.\\r\\nIn execution the mortgagee proceeded against the proper ty of the plaintiff alone (as Tarak \\'s son) and, during the pendency of the execution, assigned her rights in the decree to the Hooghly Flour Mills.\\r\\nThe Mills continued the execu tion and on the 11th of March, 1943, the claim was satisfied in this way.\\r\\nAn order of the Court was obtained sanctioning sale of a part of the mortgaged property, 20 Round Tank Lane (which belonged exclusively to the plaintiff), to the decree holder for a sum of Rs. 1,50,000.\\r\\nIt was directed that the consid eration should first be applied in payment of the claim and costs and that the decreeholder should execute a reconvey ance of the rest of the mortgaged properties in favour of the mortgagors.\\r\\nThe sanction of the Court was necessary because the judgment debtor Hari Lall (present plaintiff) was a minor.\\r\\n181 This was done and 20, Round Tank Lane, was conveyed by the present plaintiff to the Hooghly Flour Mills on the 18th of March, 1943.\\r\\nOut of the consideration a sum of Rs. 97,116 11 0 was paid to the Mills in lull satisfaction of the claim and costs then outstanding.\\r\\nThe Mills executed a reconveyance of the rest of the properties to the mortgagors in release of the mortgage on the same day.\\r\\nIn addition to this Rs. 97, 116 11 0, further sums of Rs. 14,400 and Rs. 8,100 had also been paid before the dates of these transactions.\\r\\nThese sums were paid by a Receiver who had been appointed by the Court pendente lite.\\r\\nThese sums came out of the rents which the Receiver obtained from the plaintiff \\'s property, 20 Round Tank Lane.\\r\\nThe plaintiff says that in this way he paid a total of Rs. 1,19,116 11 0 in satisfaction of the mortgage.\\r\\nHis one third share in this comes to Rs. 39,872 3 8.\\r\\nHe claims that he is entitled to receive the balance of Rs. 79,744 7 4 from the two defendants and that each of them is liable for a half of that sum namely, Rs. 39,872 3 8.\\r\\nIn addition to this the plaintiff had incurred costs amounting to Rs. 1,144 8 6 in resisting Mst.\\r\\nGyarsi \\'s claim and in connection with the reconveyance.\\r\\nHe also claims one third of this sum, namely Rs. 381 8 2, from each of the defendants.\\r\\nThe total claim against each defendant accord ingly comes to Rs. 40,253 11 10.\\r\\nIn addition to this the plaintiff asked for (1) \"a declaration that the properties mentioned in Schedule \\'A \\'. belonging to the defendants stand charged with the repayment of the sum of Rs. 80,507 7 8 being the aggregate amount due and payable by the two defendants,\" and (2) \"Decree under Order XXXIV of the Civil Procedure Code in proper form.\" Schedule A contains a list of the rest of the mortgaged properties which belong exclusively to the defendants, 24 182 It will be seen that the plaintiff claims on the basis that each of the three mortgagors is liable to contribute in equal shares towards payment of the mortgage debt.\\r\\nThe defendants did not deny their liability to contribute.\\r\\nThey only challenged the basis on which it was to be comput ed.\\r\\nThey ,pleaded a special agreement between Tarak Lal and themselves under which their liabilities were to be calcu lated in the following way.\\r\\nAccording to them, the bulk of the Rs. 80,000 was borrowed on what I have called the suit mortgage to pay off previous debts which had been incurred by the parties on earlier mortgages.\\r\\nThe amount which went towards satisfaction of the defendant \\'s portion of these earlier liabilities was only Rs. 13,259 2 4.\\r\\nTherefore, the only benefit they got out of this Rs. 80,000 was to that extent.\\r\\nThe plaintiff \\'s father Tarak on the other hand benefitted to the extent of Rs. 53,481 11 4.\\r\\nThey therefore agreed at the date of the suit mortgage that their respec tive liabilities as between themselves should be proportion ate to the benefit derived by each as above.\\r\\nSinha J., who tried the suit on the Original Side of the Calcutta High Court, held that the agreement was proved.\\r\\nOn appeal the learned Chief Justice of the High Court and Chatterjee J. disagreed and held that it was not.\\r\\nAs I agree with the learned appellate Judges for reasons which I shall give hereafter, it will be necessary to set out the further facts.\\r\\nBut I need not do so in any detail as they are given in full in the two judgments of the High Court.\\r\\nWe are only concerned here with the question of principle; so it will be more convenient to reduce the problem to its simplest terms.\\r\\nWe are concerned here with four items of property which I shall term Chittaranjan Avenue, Strand Road, No. 16 Round Tank Lane and 20 Round Tank Lane.\\r\\nThese properties were originally joint family properties, but in the year 1932 there was a partition which was compelled by reason of a suit filed by Tarak 183 against his brothers and mother.\\r\\nThe upshot was that the properties were divided as follows: (1) Bejoy, Kedar, Naku and the mother Meghamala obtained Chittaranj an Avenue.\\r\\n(2) Tarak (plaintiff \\'s father) obtained 16 Round Tank Lane and 20 Round Tank Lane.\\r\\n(3) Kedar, Naku and Biswa Lall obtained Strand Road.\\r\\nBefore this partition there were three mortgages: The first of these was executed on the 16th of June, 1925.\\r\\nAll five brothers joined in it and they mortgaged the Strand Road property for Rs. 10,000.\\r\\nThis was in favour of Bhuvan Chandra Bhur.\\r\\nThe second was on the 11th of October, 1926.\\r\\nIn this Bejoy and Tarak mortgaged their 2/5 share in Chittaranjan, Strand, Dum Dum and 20 Round Tank Lane for Rs. 5,000.\\r\\nThe mortgagee was Binode Behari Sen.\\r\\nThe third was on the 28th January, 1927.\\r\\nIn this Bejoy and Tarak again mortgaged their 2/5 share in the same items of property for Rs. 7,000 to Binode Behari Sen and Kunja Behari Sen.\\r\\nAll three sets of mortgagees, or their representatives, instituted suits on their respective mortgages and obtained final decrees Bejoy died on the 23rd of May, 1933, leaving a son Jugal.\\r\\nOn the 12th of June, 1936, came what I have called the suit mortgage executed by the three brothers,Tarak, Kedar and Naku, for Rs. 80,000.\\r\\nThe properties mortgaged were (1) the shares of Kedar and Naku in Chittaranjan Avenue and 16 Round Tank Lane; (2) 20 Round Tank Lane which had been allotted to Tarak; (3) the reversionary interest of all three in the share allotted to the mother.\\r\\nThe consideration of Rs. 80,000 was expended as follows:Rs.\\r\\n29,667 10 0 was paid by Tarak, Kedar and Naku in satisfaction of the first mortgage and the 184 later decretal charge; Rs. 11,519 11 0 in satisfaction of the second and Rs. 13,502 14 0 in satisfaction of the third.\\r\\nThe balance of Rs. 25,310 is alleged by the appellants to have been retained by Tarak.\\r\\nI have taken these figures from the judgments of the High Court.\\r\\nI understand some of the details are disputed, so I make it clear that I am not setting out the decision of this Court regarding the de tails but only giving an overall picture.\\r\\nShorn of overburdening detail the problem, reduced to its simplest terms, comes to this.\\r\\nThree persons A, B and C separately own properties of unequal value, Blackman, Whiteacre and Greenacre.\\r\\nLet us assume that their values at the material date are Rs. 30,000, Rs. 20,000 and Rs. 10,000 respectively.\\r\\nA, B and C, acting in various combinations from time to time, incur debts.\\r\\nIt matters not for present purposes whether those debts are secured on these properties or not because a time must come when their separate liabilities as amongst themselves have to be ascertained and apportioned.\\r\\nLet us assume that when that is done, A \\'s responsibility extends to Rs. 2,000, B \\'s to Rs. 3,000 and C \\'s to Rs. 5,000.\\r\\nIn order to clear off these debts, A, B and C jointly mortgage their three estates for Rs. 10,000, the total aggregate sum due at the date of the mortgage from the three of them.\\r\\nThere is no contract between them, either in the mortgage deed or otherwise, regarding their respective shares of responsibility in the Rs. 10,000.\\r\\nAt the date of redemption the mortgage debt has swollen to Rs. 15,000.\\r\\nA alone redeems by selling Blackacre, which is his separate estate, to the mortgagee for Rs. 35,000 that being the value of Blackacre at the date of redemption.\\r\\nRs. 15,000 of this is applied in satisfaction of the mortgage debt and the balance of Rs. 20,000 is retained by A.\\r\\nWhat are A \\'s rights as against B and C ? Three solutions readily suggest themselves.\\r\\nOne is that the three contribute equally.\\r\\nIn that event B would pay A Rs. 5,000 and C would pay Rs. 5,000.\\r\\n185 A second solution is that they pay in proportion to the extent of the benefits derived.\\r\\nIn that event B \\'s share would be 3/10 of Rs. 15,000, that is to say, Rs. 4,500.\\r\\nand C \\'s would be 5/10 of Rs. 15,000, that is Rs. 7,500.\\r\\nA third solution is that they pay proportionately to the values of the properties mortgaged.\\r\\nIn that event B would have to pay 2/6 of Rs. 15,000, that is Rs. 5,000, and C 1/6 of Rs. 15,000 \\' which come to Rs, 2,500.\\r\\nThe problem is to know which of these three solutions to apply.\\r\\nIn the absence of other considerations, the most equitable solution is obviously the second.\\r\\nBut the matter is not as simple as that.\\r\\nThere are certain statutory provi sions which must first be examined.\\r\\nThe learned counsel for the plaintiff respondent con tended that section 43 of the Contract Act applied.\\r\\nHe relied on the following provision : \"Each of two or more joint promisors may compel every other joint promisor to contribute equally with himself to the performance of the promise, unless a contrary intention appears from the contract.\\r\\nIf any one of two or more joint promisors makes default in such contribution, the remaining joint promisors must bear the loss arising from such default in equal shares.\\r\\n\" The argument is that unless a contrary intention appears from \"the contract\" the.\\r\\nloss must be borne equally.\\r\\nIt was contended, and with that I agree, that the words \"the con tract\" can only refer to the main contract between the promisors on the one side and the promisee on the other.\\r\\nThat contract in this case is the suit mortgage.\\r\\nThere is no contract to the contrary in the document, therefore, it was contended, the section must apply.\\r\\nThat of course would be the clear, logical and simple conclusion ii there were no other provision of law to consider.\\r\\nBut we are dealing here with a mortgage and so we have also to look to the provisions of the Transfer of Property Act.\\r\\n186 Incidentally, if this argument is pushed to its logical conclusion it would exclude any collateral or subsequent agreement between the promisors inter se which does not appear in the main contract.\\r\\nBut we need not enter into that here.\\r\\nThe sections of the Transfer of Property Act which concern us are 82 and 92.\\r\\nThe first confers a right of contribution.\\r\\nThe second a right of subrogation.\\r\\nI will consider section 82 first.\\r\\nIt runs : \"Where property subject to a mortgage belongs to two or more persons having distinct and separate rights of owner ship therein, the different shares in or parts of such property owned by such persons are, in the absence of a contract to the contrary, liable to contribute rateably to the debt secured by the mortgage . . \" That is the position here.\\r\\nNext I turn to section 92.\\r\\nThat runs \" . any co mortgagor shall, on redeeming property subject to the mortgage, have, so far as regards redemption, foreclosure or sale of such property, the same rights as the mortgagee whose mortgage he redeems may have against the mortgagor . \" That also applies.\\r\\nNow these provisions at once raise a competition between sections 82 and 92 of the Transfer of Property Act, section 43 of the Contract Act and what I might term the principle of beneficial, as opposed to proportionate or equal, distri bution of liability.\\r\\nI am of opinion that the second solution adumbrated earlier in this judgment, based on equities, must be ruled out at once.\\r\\nThese matters have been dealt with by statute and we are now only concerned with statutory rights and cannot in the face of the statutory provisions have recourse to equitable principles however fair they may appear to be at first sight.\\r\\nThe Privy Council pointed out in Rani Chhatra Kumari vs Mohan Bikram (1) that the doctrine of the (1) Pat. 851 at 869.\\r\\n187 equitable estate has no application in India.\\r\\nSo also refer ring to the right of redemption their Lordships held in Mohammad Sher Khan vs Seth Swami Dayal(1) that the right is now governed by statute, namely section 60, Transfer of Property Act.\\r\\nSulaiman c.\\r\\nJ. (later a Judge of the Federal Court) ruled Court equitable considerations in the Allahabad High Court in matters of subrogation under sections 91, 92, 101 and 105, Transfer of Property Act, in Hira Singh vs Jai Singh(2) and so did Stone C.J. and I in the Nagpur High Court in Taibai vs Wasudeorao (3).\\r\\nIn the ease of section 82 the Privy Council held in Ganesh Lal vs Charan Singh(4) that that section prescribes the conditions in which contribution is payable and that it is not proper to introduce into the matter any extrinsic principle to modify the statutory provisions.\\r\\nSo, both on authority and principle the deci sion must rest solely on whatever section is held to apply.\\r\\nSo far as section 43 is concerned, I am not prepared to apply it unless sections 82 and 92 can be excluded.\\r\\nBoth sections 43 and 82 deal with the question of contribution.\\r\\nSection 43 is a provision of the Contract Act dealing with contracts generally.\\r\\nSection 82 applies to mortgages.\\r\\nAs the right to contribution here arises out of a mortgage, I am clear that section 82 must exclude section 43 because when there is a general law and a special law dealing with a particular matter, the special excludes the general.\\r\\nIn my opinion, the whole law of mortgage in India, including the law of contribution arising out of a transaction of mort gage, is now statutory and is embodied in the Transfer of Property Act read with the Civil Procedure Code.\\r\\nI am clear we cannot travel beyond these statutory provisions.\\r\\nNow, when parties enter into a mortgage they know, or must be taken to know, that the law of mortgage provides for this very question of contribution.\\r\\nIt confers rights on the mortgagor who redeems and directs that, in the absence of a contract to the contrary, he (1) (1922) 49 I.A. 60 at Nag. 206 at 216.\\r\\n(2) A.I.R. 1937 All.\\r\\n588, at 594.\\r\\n(4) (1930) 57 I.A. 189.\\r\\n188 shall be reimbursed in a particular way out of particular properties.\\r\\nThe parties are at liberty to vary these rights and liabilities by special contract to the contrary but if they do not do so, I can see no reason why these provisions should be abrogated in favour of a section in the Contract Act which does not deal with mortgages.\\r\\nSlightly to vary the language of the Judicial Committee it is the terms and nature of the transaction viewed in the light of the law of mortgage in India which exclude the personal liability and therefore section 43, except where there is a contract to the contrary.\\r\\nIt was suggested that the rule is inequitable and will operate harshly in cases like the present.\\r\\nBut the remedy lies in the parties \\' own hands.\\r\\nIt is open to them to make a contract to the contrary.\\r\\nIf they do not, then the law steps in and makes statutory rules to which effect must be given.\\r\\nIt is not for judges to consider whether that is the best possible solution but the rule at any rate obviates the necessity of roving enquiries into the objects of a borrow ing and the application of the funds.\\r\\nOn an overall basis it is perhaps as good as any other.\\r\\nBut that hardly matters.\\r\\nThe rule is there and full effect must be given to it.\\r\\nThe learned counsel for the plaintiff respondent urged that the defendants are shut out from relying on section 82 because that was not their case and the question was never raised by them in the High Court.\\r\\nSuch reference as there is to the section was with reference to an argument urged on behalf of the plaintiff.\\r\\nI am not impressed with this objection.\\r\\n, On the facts set out by the plaintiff it is evident that he is entitled to contribution.\\r\\nThe method of computation is a matter of law and it is for the judges to apply the law to the facts stated and give the plaintiff such relief as is appropriate to the case.\\r\\nI turn now to the question of fact, the special agree ment pleaded by the defendants.\\r\\nThe only evidence in sup port of it is that of the first defendant Kedar.\\r\\nAccording to him, the agreement was an oral one 189 though the parties contemplated writing and registration.\\r\\nHis explanation for lack of any writing is this.\\r\\nHe was asked whether anything was put down in writing and he re plied : \"No, nothing was done then, but there was an understand ing that it would be done but Tarak went away to Darjeeling and when he came back he died soon after he came back and nothing could be done in writing.\\r\\n\" Later, he was asked \"Therefore, you, contemplated that there would be a document which would have to be registered in connection with the adjustment ?\" and he replied \\' \\'Yes\".\\r\\nHe also tells us that the parties regarded the matter as confidential and so only three per sons were present, Tarak, Naku and himself.\\r\\nIt is to be observed that Naku, who is the second defendant, has not entered the box.\\r\\nStopping there, it is evident that we have to rely on the memory of a very interested person speaking nearly thirteen years after the event about a transaction affecting some Rs. 80,000.\\r\\nNor is it the memory of some simple event which might well have fixed itself in his mind.\\r\\nThe question whether and at what stage parties reach finality when writ ing is in contemplation is a difficult and complex one involving delicate considerations of much nicety even when the preliminaries are all in writing.\\r\\nThe turn of a phrase here, the use of a word there, may make a world of differ ence.\\r\\nThe law regarding this was examined by me at some length in the Nagpur High Court in Shamjibhai vs Jagoo Hernchand Shah (1).\\r\\nHow much greater are the difficulties when we do not know the exact words the parties used and have to delve into the mind of a dead man (Tarak) through the impressions of an interested witness given some thirteen years after the event.\\r\\nI find it difficult to accept this version and consider it would be dangerous to do so, particularly when the (1) I.L.R. at 586 588, and 598 25 190 witness is a hesitant and reluctant one, as his examination discloses, and even evasive on some points; also when the defendants have deliberately withheld from the Court assist ance which it was in their power to render I refer to the absence of Naku, the only other person present, from the box.\\r\\nI am unable to accept this testimony.\\r\\nNor is this the only point.\\r\\nDespite the insistence of the witness that the parties were on good terms and trusted each other, the fact remains that Tarak found it necessary to institute a suit for partition against his brothers and fight it to a finish.\\r\\nThey were not able to arrange matters amicably.\\r\\nit was suggested in argument that was probably because of creditors who could not be persuaded to agree and it was pointed out that creditors were joined in the suit, but that is not wholly convincing particularly when it is admitted that Tarak was insisting on writing and regis tration.\\r\\nIt is evident that he, at any rate, was not prepared to leave matters as they were and trust to the good faith of his brothers.\\r\\nNow we know that Tarak was in Calcutta about three months after the date of the alleged agreement.\\r\\nWe also know that Kedar was most anxious to have such an agreement, for he tells us so.\\r\\nHe tells us further that there was before them a rough draft of the terms.\\r\\nThat document was produced in Court.\\r\\nBut the draft was neither signed nor initialled.\\r\\nThe only inference I can draw from these facts is that Tarak either refused to agree or had not made up his mind.\\r\\nThe figures put forward by the defendants were contested on behalf of the plaintiff and we were given an alternative set of figures which in turn were contested by the other side, but they were enough to show that the matter is not as straightforward or as simple as the defendants would have us believe.\\r\\nTherefore, Tarak \\'s inaction during the three months and the omission of either side to initial the draft point clearly, at the lowest, to hesitancy on Tarak \\'s part.\\r\\nIt may be he wanted his lawyers to examine his position or it may be he refused to have anything to do with it.\\r\\n191 It is just possible that there were negotiations, but on those broad facts I am not prepared to believe the witness when he tells us, or rather suggests, that the parties reached finality.\\r\\nIt would in any event be dangerous to believe a witness in circumstances like this.\\r\\nBut when the defendants deliberately withheld from the Court that assist ance which is its due I can only conclude that their case was too shaky to stand further proving.\\r\\nOn these broad grounds alone I would hold that the agreement is not proved.\\r\\nMuch was made in argument about the rule regarding the weight to be given to the estimate of the judge who saw and heard a witness.\\r\\nI do not doubt the soundness of the rule but it can be pushed too far as their Lordships of the Judicial Committee pointed out in Virappa vs Periakaruppan(1).\\r\\nIn the present case, the learned Judge who tried the case believed Kedar not because of his demea nour but because the learned Judge considered that his story was inherently probable.\\r\\nThat, however, is a matter which the learned appellate Judges were in as good a position to appreciate as the learned trial Judge.\\r\\nIf probability is to be the test, then the conduct of Tarak suggests that it is very improbable that he could have agreed.\\r\\nThat leaves at large the nature of the relief to which the plaintiff is entitled.\\r\\nIn the view I take, there being no contract to the contrary, the plaintiff \\'s only remedy is under section 92 of the Transfer of Property Act read with section 82.\\r\\nThe question is, has his suit been so framed ? The plaintiff has claimed separate personal reliefs against the defendants.\\r\\nAs there is no personal covenant as between the mortgagors or any \"contract to the contrary\", that relief \\' cannot be granted.\\r\\nThe plaintiff has also asked for a declaration of charge and for a decree under Order XXXIV, Civil Procedure Code.\\r\\nThe declaration of charge standing by itself is superfluous although Order XXXIV, rule 2 (1) does require that the decree in a mortgage suit shall (1) A.I.R. 1945 P.C. 35 at 37.\\r\\n192 \"declare the amount so due\" at the date of the decree.\\r\\nBut reading the two reliefs together, I am of opinion that though the claim is inartistically worded the plaintiff has in substance asked for a mortgage decree up to a limit of Rs. 40,253 11 10 with interest against each defendant.\\r\\nNo other kind of decree could be given under Order XXXIV.\\r\\nTherefore, though he has not used the word \"subrogation\" he has asked in substance for the relief to which a subrogee would be entitled under the Transfer of Property Act.\\r\\nI would be slow to throw out a claim on a mere techni cality of pleading when the substance of the thing is there and no prejudice is caused to the other side, however clum sily or inartistically the plaint may be worded.\\r\\nIn any event, it is always open to a court to give a plaintiff such general or other relief as it deems just to the same extent as if it had been asked for, provided that occasions no prejudice to the other side beyond what can be compensated for in costs.\\r\\nIn the circumstances, in the absence of agreement be tween the parties as to the figures, I would remand this case to the High Court for (1) an enquiry regarding the sum paid by the plaintiff \\'s father for satisfaction of the mortgage dated the 12th June, 1936, (2) for the interest due on that sum at the contract rate in the mortgage from the date of payment to the date of decree, (a) lot the values of the various properties mortgaged at the date of the mort gage.\\r\\nWhen the figures are ascertained, I would direct that the liability of each defendant be ascertained separately in the manner prescribed by section 82, Transfer of Property Act.\\r\\nthe event of this liability exceeding Rs. 40,253 11 10 with interest against either defendant, I would direct that his liability be reduced to Rs. 40,253 11 10 plus interest.\\r\\nWhen these figures are ascertained, I would direct that a mortgage decree for sale be drawn up in the usual way affording either defendant the right to redeem the whole of the balance of the property 193 (excluding the plaintiff \\'s) for the aggregate sum due as above and, in default of payment, limiting the liabilities of each item of property to the sum rateably due on it under section 82.\\r\\nOn the question of costs.\\r\\nThe plaintiff repudiated section 82 in the course of the arguments before us and rested his case on section 43 of the Contract Act, nor did he clearly and unmistakably plead a case of subrogation in his plaint even in the alternative.\\r\\nThe defendants, on the other hand, set up a case which has failed on the facts.\\r\\nI would, therefore, direct each side to bear its own costs in this appeal.\\r\\nAs regards the costs incurred in the Courts below and any costs which may be necessitated by a further enquiry, they will be determined according to the final result of the litigation and with due regard to all matters bearing on the question of costs.\\r\\nFAZL ALI J.\\r\\nI agree.\\r\\nCase remanded.\\r\\n', {'entities': [[5, 28,
